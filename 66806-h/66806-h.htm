<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The</span> Young Continentals&#8221; series deals
with the experiences of four boys in the
American Revolution. One of them, Nat
Brewster, is from the hills about Wyoming,
Ben Cooper is from Philadelphia, while the
Prentiss twin brothers come from Boston.</p>

<p>In the first book of the series, &#8220;The Young
Continentals at Lexington,&#8221; Nat Brewster
played the leading part&mdash;a part full of daring
and enterprise. In the second book, &#8220;The
Young Continentals at Bunker Hill,&#8221; Ezra
Prentiss replaced Nat as the principal figure,
while in the present volume, George Prentiss
steps into the foreground.</p>

<p>The first book dealt with the revolution
from the stirring of the wrath of the colonies
to the first blows struck at Lexington and Concord
Bridge. The second began where the first
ended, and related the events that took place
during the siege of Boston, including the fight
on Breed&#8217;s Hill and ended with the evacuation
of the city by the British.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>The present, or third, takes up the thread
of the great struggle where the second laid it
down; it deals with the preparation for defending
New York City, describes the battle
of Long Island, the crossing of the Delaware
and the capture of the Hessians at Trenton.</p>

<p>The fourth book, &#8220;The Young Continentals
at Monmouth,&#8221; takes in the encounters
around Philadelphia, including the battle of
Germantown, and ends with Washington&#8217;s
brilliant success at Monmouth. Ben Cooper
fills the eye in this volume; and during the
course of the story appears the celebrated
Molly Pitcher, the girl who served a gun at
Monmouth and whom Washington afterward
made a sergeant on the field of battle. This
volume is now in preparation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW MERCHANT DANA BOARDED THE<br />
&#8220;NANCY BREEN&#8221; AND WHAT CAME OF IT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A dry</span>, weazened little man with a halt in
his step passed &#8220;The Brigantine&#8221; inn which
faced the East River at the foot of Broad
Street; and as he did so, he peered in at the
windows and doors, for it was a fine spring
morning and they stood wide. &#8220;The Brigantine&#8221;
was a place for captains and mates and
merchants to congregate; and all about it
were warehouses, shipping offices and places
for the sale of maritime stores.</p>

<p>Apparently what the weazened little man
sought was not visible in or about the tavern,
for he went halting across the roadway and
out upon the wharf, peering inquisitively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
here and there through a pair of huge, horn-rimmed
glasses.</p>

<p>A good-sized shallop was moored to the
wharf. She had come down the Sound during
the night; a lean looking lad with a
vacant grin upon his face was furling her
clumsy lugs, and in the waist the skipper was
coiling a line with expert neatness.</p>

<p>The dry little man limped to the string-piece;
readjusting his glasses, he inquired in
a high thin voice which squeaked when he
sought to raise it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just in to-day, captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An hour ago,&#8221; replied the skipper.</p>

<p>The little man stepped upon the rail and
then with great care reached the deck. Approaching
the skipper, he proceeded with
marked anxiety and some craft:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you hail from Newport?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;New London,&#8221; replied the shallop&#8217;s
master.</p>

<p>The anxiety of the little man now became
tinged with eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not bring a passenger, I know,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong, master,&#8221; returned the sailor. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
did, and there he sits, as natural as you
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bronzed, well-made youth was leaning
over the craft&#8217;s stern, gazing out over the
waters of the bay to where several black
hulled frigates swung frowningly at anchor;
his eyes seemed to soberly measure the flaunt
of their colors, and the bravado of their staring
ports.</p>

<p>At once the weazened little man was at his
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, young gentleman,&#8221; said
he, with a squeak. &#8220;It is a beautiful day, is
it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man turned and surveyed the
newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;it is a fine day
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You came down from New London, I
understand,&#8221; questioned the dry little man.
The youth nodded rather absently. However,
the other rubbed his hands with quite a degree
of briskness and seemed greatly pleased.
&#8220;And,&#8221; said he, positively, &#8220;you were required
to deliver&mdash;ah&mdash;something to&mdash;ah&mdash;some
one?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>The youth was alert enough now; he
examined the little man with inquiring eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>The hand rubbing now indicated vast relief;
but in a moment it ceased, and an expression
of disquiet came into the wrinkled,
high-featured face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; spoke the little man, eagerly,
&#8220;this vessel is the &#8216;Nancy Breen&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; answered the other.</p>

<p>The disquiet instantly departed; the squeak
in the voice was full and content as the newcomer
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I had really forgotten to inquire; and
it was a rather important question, too. But
no matter.&#8221; Here the voice lowered itself
into a pitch of confidence. &#8220;I was sent to
give you a few instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From headquarters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You are not to make yourself
known. I was to impress that upon you
fully. Neither are you to call at any one&#8217;s
lodgings.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man seemed puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That has rather an odd sound,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Where am I to transact my business?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;There are many places where it may be
done without attracting attention. But the
best of these perhaps is the &#8216;Wheat Sheaf,&#8217;
an inn just above the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand it,&#8221; said the
other. &#8220;Will you be kind enough to explain
why all this secrecy is necessary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Secrecy,&#8221; and the weazened little man
made a wide gesture, &#8220;is never a bad thing.
And while some of the reasons for this exercise
of it are most obvious, others are as unknown
to myself as to you. I am not a
person of sufficient consequence to warrant
my being told any but the outside facts. If
you desire to learn more, you&#8217;d do well to
inquire of those who are better informed.&#8221;
He seemed about to take his departure at
this, but paused. &#8220;Shall we say the &#8216;Wheat
Sheaf,&#8217; then, to-morrow night at nine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is necessary,&#8221; said the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, it is necessary, or I should not
have been sent to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little man walked haltingly to the rail,
climbed upon it and then upon the wharf.</p>

<p>However, he had not gone a dozen yards
when he was halted. A stout, choleric old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
gentleman came stamping along; he had an
oaken staff in his hand, and its tip rang
angrily upon the stones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Dana,&#8221; cried he, &#8220;well met.&#8221;
He paused before the dry little man and
seemed to bristle with indignation. &#8220;I have
been given to understand, sir, that the &#8216;Sea
Gull&#8217; is not permitted to sail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to say, Mr. Camp,&#8221; replied the
other earnestly, &#8220;that your information is
quite correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of the name of Camp, the
youth on board the &#8220;Nancy Breen&#8221; became
more attentive; indeed, the expression upon
his face seemed one of recognition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they mean to ruin us between them?&#8221;
demanded the stout old gentleman. &#8220;Do
they insist upon making beggars of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>He flourished the oaken staff and his face
grew redder still.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will face these miscreants,&#8221; declared he.
&#8220;I will have an understanding. Four of our
ships have been held up in a month. Four
in one month, do you understand? But still
you do nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will but listen to reason,&#8221; Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Dana said, but the angry old gentleman took
him up in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reason!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Reason! Was there
ever a time, Mr. Dana, that I refused to harken
to it? Answer me, sir! Specify an instance
when I turned away from even common sense.
I defy you to do it, sir; I defy you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now, Mr. Camp, don&#8217;t be vexed. I
did not mean to insinuate that you were not
open to reason. Nothing of the sort, dear
sir, believe me. I merely desired that you
listen to my remarks on the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other planted the point of his staff
firmly upon the stones.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have great respect for your capabilities,
Mr. Dana,&#8221; said he. &#8220;No man more so. But
the thing is beyond explanation. The vocabulary
of Dr. Johnson himself would throw
no light upon it.&#8221; He lifted the staff and
pointed across the peaks of the buildings to
where the British flag flew from a pole in
the fort. &#8220;Do you see that? It should be
an emblem of authority&mdash;the symbol of law.
But it&#8217;s not! It should mark the power of
the English nation&mdash;of English civilization.
But it does not. Authority, law, the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
nation, and its civilization as well, are a jest,
Mr. Dana. Singly and together they are a
jest for every low fellow in the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; expostulated the other, &#8220;can you
not see that it will not last? It is only a
momentary turbulence. It will pass. The
good folks will come to their senses by and
by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be true enough,&#8221; said the old
gentleman. &#8220;Indeed, I have no doubt but
that it is, for the sight of bare bayonets in the
hands of resolute fellows will make them run
fast enough, I warrant you. But, nevertheless,
that does not alter the present condition.
It does not remove the fact that an English
governor is penned up in Fort George, that
English troops with muskets, cannon and
other equipment sit idly by and permit His
Majesty&#8217;s town to be overrun by rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When Tryon returns he will make an end
of it. He is even now on the sea, so I have
heard. The situation needs only a resolved
man,&#8221; and the little gentleman waved a hand
assuringly.</p>

<p>But the other was not in the least quieted
by this view.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>&#8220;The people of New York,&#8221; said he, bitterly,
&#8220;would, from what I have seen of them,
dare do anything against the peace, if it be
agreed with their rebellious fancies. The
king&#8217;s desires are not enough for them. They
must have representatives in Parliament, forsooth!
They must not be taxed without their
own consent! Nothing must be done in the
matter of the colonies that they don&#8217;t, in their
pride, consider fit and proper.&#8221; Mr. Camp
laughed scornfully. &#8220;Oh, no, no, Mr. Dana,
you are a good man of business and far-sighted
enough in trade; but you are blind to what
is going on around you.&#8221;</p>

<p>This conversation was plainly heard by
those on board the &#8220;Nancy Breen.&#8221; The
skipper winked at the bronzed young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old gentleman seems to fancy a spell
of bad weather,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he doesn&#8217;t seem the sort to strip and
run before a gale,&#8221; returned the young passenger.
&#8220;Do you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By reputation only, Master Prentiss. He&#8217;s
a merchant in the West India trade, now retired
from active service. He&#8217;s said to be as
rich as the king himself; anyway, he lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
somewhere in the Jerseys in a fine manor
house and comes to New York but seldom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a retired merchant,&#8221; commented
George Prentiss, &#8220;he takes an uncommon interest
in shipping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as for that, he&#8217;s retired only from the
active work of it. He still has his moneys in
the trade, I&#8217;m told. The gentleman who just
now boarded us is his partner. But,&#8221; and the
skipper looked at George inquiringly, &#8220;of
course you knew that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But George shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merchant Camp I know something of,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but Mr. Dana I never laid eyes upon
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lexington had been fought and the sneering
British column driven back upon Boston.
Then that city had been besieged by an army
of farmers and mechanics; and Breed&#8217;s Hill
had witnessed its desperate defeat, though we
commonly now speak of the fight as the battle
of Bunker Hill. And, finally, the British
had run from Boston to their ships under the
pitiless cannonading of Washington&#8217;s batteries.</p>

<p>New York was trembling and expectant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Any day might witness the arrival of a British
fleet; and in the meantime the colonists
were preparing its defenses. George Prentiss
was thinking of these things, his eyes once
more fixed upon the frigates afar off. The
skipper having coiled the line to his satisfaction
came toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you first came aboard me at New
London,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I judged by the trim of
your yards that you were from the army up
Boston way.&#8221;</p>

<p>George nodded, and the skipper, twisting a
strand of rope between his tarry fingers, proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a good many of them of late,
and have come to know them at sight.&#8221;
He bent nearer to his passenger. &#8220;Maybe
you&#8217;ve come to New York on special business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;And maybe,&#8221; suggested the shallop&#8217;s master,
&#8220;you have particular documents stowed
away under hatches.&#8221; George did not reply
to this, and the sailor proceeded: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
think me prying, Master Prentiss, for I&#8217;m
not. I don&#8217;t poke about meddling in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
people&#8217;s affairs. But I couldn&#8217;t help hearing
most of what old Merchant Dana said to you
a few moments ago; and if you&#8217;ll take my
word for it, you&#8217;ll have nothing to do with
his instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>George looked into the candid face of the
speaker inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not of the sort I take you to be,&#8221; explained
the sailor. &#8220;Old Camp there,&#8221; pointing
to the stout old gentleman with the oaken
staff, &#8220;is said to be the most rabid Tory in all
New York. But I&#8217;ve heard that questioned.
Merchant Dana is a milder mannered man, to
be sure; but those that know claim he&#8217;s
more to be feared than his partner.&#8221;</p>

<p>George looked toward the two merchants,
who were now pacing the wharf. There was
no abatement in old Camp&#8217;s anger; and Mr.
Dana, halting along beside him, still strove to
calm him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; stated the latter with confidence,
&#8220;we shall have but a short time to
wait. It can&#8217;t be otherwise. When the ships
of the line and the troopers, bearing His
Majesty&#8217;s army, left Boston, where do you
suppose they were headed?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Mr. Camp sniffed and snorted in great
disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it matter,&#8221; asked he, &#8220;where
they were headed? Apparently they are of
no great consequence, or they would have
been able to hold Boston. And more than
that, sir. If they had been worth the rations
fed them by King George, they would have
gone out and soundly beaten the rabble that
opposed them as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mr. Dana patiently evaded this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without a doubt they are coming to New
York,&#8221; declared he, hopefully. &#8220;Without a
doubt, Mr. Camp. We shall then see what
we shall see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said the indignant gentleman, &#8220;so
we shall. But I expect little. Lord Howe
may be a very excellent officer, but he has
yet to prove it upon this side of the world. It
seems that he is much of Colden&#8217;s kidney.
He&#8217;d rather parley than act. To show these
fellows who&#8217;s master needs a strong hand&mdash;not
a long tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Mr. Dana,
but the other waved his words away with a
sweep of the heavy staff.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;There is that rascally renegade whom
Washington sent here,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I
refer to Charles Lee. Though a greater
villain never lived, still he had a grasp of
matters that our own leaders might pattern
by. Did he parley and hesitate when he
arrived? He did not, I warrant you! He set
to work in spite of all opposition. The king&#8217;s
men threatened him; the soldiery made shift
to show their teeth and the shipping in the
bay cleared their decks. But without stopping
to ask their leave, he seized upon the persons
of his most outspoken opponents; then he
stared the troops out of countenance and
defied the frigates. Finally he stripped the
British batteries of their guns, began to
recruit an army, and build forts and redoubts
to guard all the approaches to the city.
While this man, Mr. Dana,&#8221; and the staff
rang upon the stones, &#8220;has my unqualified
disapproval, I cannot refuse him my admiration.
He understands his duty and he does it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, thank goodness, he&#8217;s been ordered
from the city by his chiefs,&#8221; ejaculated Mr.
Dana, fervently. &#8220;One could scarcely count
upon one&#8217;s liberty while he was here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;This hectoring fellow, Putnam, who is
now in command, as he calls it, is little
milder in his arrestings and confiscatings,&#8221;
complained Camp. &#8220;And I understand that
the arch-rebel himself is even now upon his
way here. When he arrives, I suppose there&#8217;ll
be scarce a tree or pole in the town that&#8217;ll not
have the body of some poor Loyalist gentleman
dangling from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you actually believe that Washington
will have the effrontery to show himself here,
with the king&#8217;s fleet and an army due at any
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>His companion snapped his fingers. &#8220;Mr.
Washington,&#8221; declared he, &#8220;is to all appearances
a man of enterprise. To be sure he&#8217;ll
come here, and he&#8217;ll bring his rabble of raw
countrymen with him to overawe us.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the period in which he had engaged
his friend and business partner as above, the
angry manner of Mr. Camp and his excited
gestures had not failed to attract attention.
Workmen, carters and merchants&#8217; clerks had
gathered into little groups; seamen upon the
decks of vessels near by grinned and pointed
him out to their mates. Few could hear his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
words; but his anger was so demonstrative,
his gestures so eloquent that none missed his
meaning. A lot of rough-looking fellows
were lounging at the end of the wharf upon
an upturned yawl; they had the appearance
of deep-water sailors, wore knives in their
belts and possessed an altogether ugly look.</p>

<p>The words of the old gentleman were perfectly
audible to these men, as they were no
great distance from him, and their frowning
brows and muttered remarks showed that
they did not take the matter as good-humoredly
as those upon the shallop.</p>

<p>Mr. Dana grasped at his companion&#8217;s disparaging
reference to Washington&#8217;s army.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raw countrymen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;describes
them exactly. And do you suppose that such
an array can hope to stand before the trained
regiments of England?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if the trained regiments of England
are properly directed. But I have little
expectation that they will be. And in the
meantime, our business&mdash;everybody&#8217;s business&mdash;is
at a standstill. It is an outrage&mdash;a
scandal! The leaders of this shameful revolt
should be whipped at the cart&#8217;s tail!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>As he spoke these words, the pair in their
pacing had arrived at a point very near to the
group of seamen before mentioned. One of
these, a hulking fellow, with a bare, bull
throat and a particularly unprepossessing face,
lifted himself from his lounging posture
against the yawl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak so sharp, Master Camp,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;There are those here by whom your
words are not favored overmuch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman turned upon him wrathfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of your impudence, sailor!&#8221; cried
he. &#8220;Speak when you are spoken to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The seaman sneered. &#8220;You are very high
and mighty, Master Camp, I know,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But you and your like will change your
manners before long.&#8221;</p>

<p>The short temper of the stout old Tory
flared forth. &#8220;Before matters are done
with,&#8221; exclaimed he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see such as you
soundly cudgeled. I knew what would
come of flying in the face of the king and
resisting his just tax. One meets with impudence
at every turn; an upholder of law
and decency is insulted by every low fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
who chooses to turn his tongue upon
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the cautious Mr. Dana took his friend
by the arm and tried to draw him away. But
the wrathful old Loyalist shook him off, and
swept into a bitter tirade in which he reproached
and abused all who opposed the
king&#8217;s government. His furious manner and
high-pitched voice drew a highly entertained
crowd; and through this came a young girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear Miss Peggy,&#8221; squeaked Mr.
Dana, greatly relieved. &#8220;I am delighted that
you have come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked she, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gotten upon politics again, and I
can&#8217;t control him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy listened for a moment to the highly
colored language of the old Tory. Mr. Dana,
with a nervous glance about, proceeded in a
lowered tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Such sentiments as his are not altogether
popular in this part of the town. Indeed, I
don&#8217;t know but what they are actually dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Prentiss was watching the girl.
There was a proud, perhaps even a scornful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
lift to her chin; and now, when she, with
much composure, approached the furious old
king&#8217;s man, his interest increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle,&#8221; she said. Instantly the torrent
of heated words stopped and he turned to
her. &#8220;Please come away. You will make
yourself ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a moment, my dear,&#8221; returned Merchant
Camp, &#8220;in just a moment. First,&#8221;
facing the throng, &#8220;I must try and bring
these people back to a sense of their duty. I
must endeavor, as an honest man, to make
them see the scandal of their attempts to
undermine the power of a kind sovereign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind,&#8221; cried a voice. &#8220;Kind, did you
say, Master Camp?&mdash;and he hiring Hessians
and Brunswickers to cross the seas and murder
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should he not?&#8221; the old Tory
demanded. &#8220;Why should he not? Is it not
given to him to chastise his rebellious rascals
in whatever manner he will? Who are you&mdash;what
are you that you should oppose the
king&#8217;s desires, whatever they may be? A
pack of scurvy villains, most of you. A
parcel of rogues that should be ironed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
hold of one of yonder frigates. If I had the
will of you, I&#8217;d&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But here he was interrupted by the bull
throated seaman, who had by this time risen
to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belay, master,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The time has
gone by when such as you can hector us as
you please. It would be better for you if
you kept your tongue between your teeth, old
gentleman,&#8221; added the sailor. &#8220;As the matter
rests, if you were a younger man, I&#8217;d try
something else on you beside words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, you rascal!&#8221; sputtered the king&#8217;s
man, wrathfully, &#8220;would you threaten
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his staff and made a quavering
blow at the other; the girl cried out sharply,
as the seaman tore the weapon from the old
man&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would, would you, you old walrus,&#8221;
cried the brawny tar. And with that he
lifted his brawny fist. Once more the girl
cried out. She sprang between the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>But the brute in the seaman was aroused;
with a rough push he forced her aside; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
he took a menacing step toward the old man,
his hand lifted once more.</p>

<p>This time he found himself face to face
with George Prentiss, who had leaped from
the deck of the shallop at the girl&#8217;s first cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, sailor,&#8221; cried the young man, placing
one hand against the tar&#8217;s broad chest, &#8220;a
fair and fit lad like yourself is surely not going
to grapple with an old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he&#8217;s an old un is not my fault,&#8221;
growled the other; &#8220;so get out of the way,
my hearty, before I hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But young Prentiss laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for that,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you may be able.
But then again, you may not.&#8221; Then over
his shoulder he spoke swiftly to Mr. Dana,
&#8220;Take him away&mdash;and the young lady, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The seaman&#8217;s hard face had darkened.
&#8220;So, my young ship-jack,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
got your doubts, have you? You don&#8217;t think,
then,&#8221; with a sneer, &#8220;that you&#8217;re as much too
young as the other is too old?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; said George, still good
humoredly. &#8220;But nevertheless, sailor, we&#8217;ll
try to pass it all by. No harm has been done
any one; so we&#8217;ll say no more about it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s trying to get the weather gauge of
you, Ben,&#8221; called one of the seamen. &#8220;Belay
the jaw-tackle and give him your starboard
gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay,&#8221; chorused the others, while the
assemblage voiced their approval. &#8220;Rake
him, mate.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the tar did not require encouragement;
he shoved his face within an inch or two of
the youth&#8217;s and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;King&#8217;s men are not liked, my hearty, in
New York port, no matter if they be old or
young.&#8221; And with that he made a short,
wicked chop at the young fellow&#8217;s head. But
George evaded it like a flash, and both his
fists began to drub at the tar&#8217;s stomach and
ribs. Then as the man swung once more for
his head, the youth leaped out of distance;
but like a flash he closed in with a driving
hit to the body, followed by a perfect fusillade
of shorter punches. Again he drew back;
the tar, breathless and gasping, stood still and
gazed at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re well braced and bolted, sailor,&#8221;
said George, still smilingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen them
strike under less than that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;ll not be me, my lad,&#8221; gasped Ben
Buntline. &#8220;You&#8217;re a good hand, but look to
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he rushed in, his thick arms
swinging like flails. But George stepped
briskly to and fro; none of the blows seemed
to come within a foot of him; and so ludicrous
did the seaman&#8217;s attempts to strike him
become that the gathering began to hoot and
cheer. This not only angered the man himself,
but also his mates. They arose at once;
several drew their knives, while one exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What, you land sharks, will you make
game of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>One or two rushed to the assistance of their
friends; and seeing this, the smile vanished
from George&#8217;s face; he began striking with a
speed and power that soon brought his antagonist
to his knees. But just then there came
the tramp of hoofs upon the stones of the
wharf, and the voice of Mr. Dana cried
thinly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Herbert! This way, lieutenant, this
way!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd scattered; the seamen quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
grasped the situation, for they picked up their
dazed comrade and bustled him away just as
a troop of mounted militia rode up.</p>

<p>The officer at the head of the party was a
heavy-browed, sullen looking young man in a
lieutenant&#8217;s dress. As none now remained of
the throng save George, this person rode up
to him and said curtly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, and is General Putnam&#8217;s plain
order against rioting not enough for you?
Do you require to be personally warned?&#8221;</p>

<p>George Prentiss looked quietly into the
frowning face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it would be as well
for you to inform yourself as to what has
taken place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant was about to make an ugly
rejoinder, but just then the girl came forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; she said, and it seemed to
George that the proud lift of her chin was
more accentuated than it had been before,
&#8220;this gentleman is in no way to blame. If
it had not been for his kindness, we might
have fared rather badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Merchant Camp also came forward.
&#8220;Nephew,&#8221; said he to the colonial lieutenant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
and his voice was not without a trace of
humor, &#8220;I had not thought to ever welcome
any one who wore that uniform. But I was
well enough pleased to see you just now. As
for the youth, it&#8217;s just as your sister says.
He&#8217;s a fine up-standing fellow, whoever he is,
and I shall be delighted to see more of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he shook George warmly by the hand,
and proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very like you know the business place of
Mr. Dana. If you have nothing better to do
some day, pray come and see me there. I
shall think it a kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The merchant remained in conversation
with George, while the lieutenant, dismounting,
dismissed his troop in charge of a
sergeant; then leading his horse, he walked
up the wharf at the side of his sister. When
old Camp had said good-bye and also gone
stumping up the wharf, Mr. Dana brought
his wrinkled, high-featured face close to the
young man&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it&#8217;s the &#8216;Wheat
Sheaf,&#8217; and the time is nine to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so he limped after his partner with
many a backward glance and nod.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>SHOWS THE RECEPTION GEORGE MET WITH IN<br />
NEW YORK TOWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> George Prentiss stepped aboard the
shallop once more he found the master and
crew of one awaiting him in high admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, lad,&#8221; cried the former, in a tone of
satisfaction, &#8220;you can manage yourself as
trimly as any craft of your tonnage that I
ever clapped an eye on. Give me your fist!</p>

<p>&#8220;I was surprised,&#8221; he added, &#8220;to see you
go over the side to the rescue of that scolding
old fellow. A lad that&#8217;s exchanged shots
with the British at Boston, as I have no doubt
you have done, could hardly be expected to
take up the quarrel of a Tory in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As it happens,&#8221; said young Prentiss,
gravely, &#8220;Mr. Camp is a sort of connection of
mine. The girl you saw just now and the
young militia officer are my cousins, though,
indeed, I never saw them before. In a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
like this families are divided&mdash;some members
of it are upon one side, and some upon the
others. This teaches me to be a trifle tolerant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said the master of the vessel, &#8220;I
understand. Well,&#8221; with a lifting of the
brows, &#8220;if you have Tories in your own
household, I&#8217;m sorry for you. It must be
lowering to a man&#8217;s pride to know that his
own kin would stoop to such ideas, and when
they are once set that way there is little hope
of ever making them alter their views. Once
a Tory, always a Tory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always,&#8221; and George shook his head.
&#8220;I was, in the beginning, a king&#8217;s man myself.
My friends convinced me that the king&#8217;s
way was the best&mdash;that the colonists should
submit&mdash;that they were rushing to destruction
in making an armed resistance. They
assured me that Gage&#8217;s force would deal
gently with my countrymen&mdash;that not a shot
would be fired in anger upon them. But
Lexington showed me the falseness of this.
I knew then that the Americans had taken
the only hopeful way to secure justice; and
from that time on I was one of them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>But the seaman shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you tell me this is so, lad, I believe
it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But it&#8217;s only an odd case.
The Tory, take him all standing, is a narrow
bigot who cannot see beyond the tip of his
nose. He was brought up to believe that
King George and his government were ordained
by Providence; and the stiffest gale
that ever blew would not sweep him from his
moorings.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Prentiss did not reply to this; he
had no keen reason for converting the shallop&#8217;s
master to an opposite way of thinking;
and even if he had, he knew it would be of
no use to try.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll be setting about my affairs,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s coming on midday.&#8221;</p>

<p>The skipper hitched up his trousers. &#8220;Of
course,&#8221; stated he, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what your
affairs are; but, as I said before, I have suspicion
of them. And look you, my hearty,
give no heed to old Dana&#8217;s talk. Go about
your business in your own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said young Prentiss. &#8220;I
had made up my mind to do that. Mr.
Dana,&#8221; he added to himself, &#8220;has been mistaken;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
he expected one passenger, evidently,
and found another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Directly up Broad Street he made his way
until he came to Beaver; here he turned in
toward the Parade at the foot of Broadway.
The red-coated sentries were mounting guard
upon the walls of the fort; the British ensign
floated from its tall pole; but the streets were
filled with the blue and buff of the young
American army, and the numerous and
strangely devised flags of the revolution.</p>

<p>Apparently the Parade was a favorite place
for the showing of oneself in the middle of the
day. Ladies in carriages and upon horseback
drove and cantered up and down the paved
ways; groups of citizens and scores of militia
officers stood here and there; companies of raw
troops were being put sternly through the
manual by hard-faced sergeants.</p>

<p>As George walked across the Parade he
gained not a little attention, for the dispatch
bag which hung across his arm, the broad
shoulder belt supporting a steel hilted hanger,
the pistol butt which showed beneath his coat,
gave him a particularly businesslike appearance.
And then his bronzed looks, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
breadth of his shoulders, and the cock of his
hat, spoke of a youth to be reckoned with in
any company.</p>

<p>Pausing before one of the numerous groups,
he inquired politely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you have the goodness to direct me
to headquarters?&#8221;</p>

<p>A foppish young dragoon officer with a
mincing manner, who had been entertaining
the occupants of a carriage beside which he
stood, turned upon the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah!&#8221; said he, &#8220;you have news for old
Put, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in the cheap familiarity
of this that aroused the anger of young
Prentiss. He had seen the bluff, straightforward
Putnam face a thousand dangers that
night upon Breed&#8217;s Hill, he had seen him
storming in the midst of the rout, striving to
rally his men, pleading with them to make
one more desperate stand. And now to hear
him so referred to by this mincing fop filled
him with resentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;My business is with General Putnam,&#8221;
said he, stiffly.</p>

<p>The dragoon marked his manner and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
laughed, while at the same time his glances
bade the ladies in the carriage mark his wit.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a right proper
New Englander, indeed.&#8221; He smoothed the
sleeves of his well fitting coat and flecked some
invisible specks from his epauletted shoulders.
&#8220;They hold their officers as something more
than human at Massachusetts Bay,&#8221; he proceeded,
addressing the group of militiamen.
&#8220;And one must not style them with anything
less than their full dignity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The militiamen smiled broadly, while the
citizens guffawed; the ladies in the carriage
tittered, and cast mirthful looks at the youth
from the northern colony. But one among
them did not smile; and George noticed this
at the moment in which he recognized her.
It was Peggy Camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man wearing a uniform for the first
time,&#8221; said George tartly, and with a sweep
of the eyes that took in the other&#8217;s immaculate
costume, &#8220;should show a little respect for a
soldier of the general&#8217;s known service. At least
that is the belief generally held in Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fop choked, stuttered and grew red at
this biting answer. The mirthful looks of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
ladies were now turned upon him; and while
he was mentally casting about for some witty
rejoinder, a soggy looking man in the dress
of a merchant and a countenance like a point
of interrogation, took young Prentiss eagerly
by the sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is fresh news, then, from Boston
way? Of what nature is it, young man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any news that I personally have,&#8221; said
the youth, &#8220;is very commonplace and of no
value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you personally have? Ah, yes, perhaps,&#8221;
and here the man&#8217;s face grew more
interrogative than ever. &#8220;But your dispatches?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are for the eye of the commandant
of New York,&#8221; replied young Prentiss,
annoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely,&#8221; and the merchant smiled in
a very knowing way, &#8220;you had a little glance
at them on the way&mdash;the briefest, of course,
but still a glance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The youth&#8217;s face flushed beneath the bronze.
&#8220;Do you speak in ignorance of a soldier&#8217;s duty,
sir?&#8221; demanded he; &#8220;or is this meant for an
insult?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>The inquisitive face of the merchant paled.
&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried he in much haste. &#8220;An
insult! Goodness bless you, young man&mdash;no!
Why, I thought the thing would be the
most natural in the world. Just a slight
glimpse, you see. What hurt would it do?
I&#8217;ll leave it to any gentleman here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But none of the party saw fit to support
him; and much abashed he fell to the rear,
not relishing George&#8217;s looks. The foppish
dragoon had by this time recovered, and now
put himself forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume by your tone,&#8221; said he, acidly,
&#8220;that you hold the commission of Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>But George shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; and the presumption of the
dragoon immediately began to mount. &#8220;A
common soldier, and have you the effrontery
to use this manner to officers and gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a stiffening among the militiamen
at this; they had re-collected themselves and
were beginning to feel their superiority. But
George, his temper returned to its level, only
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sirs,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I stopped to ask a civil
question in a civil manner. If this gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
has received what he considers a sharp answer,
he has himself to blame for it only. And as
to the commissions,&#8221; here George squared his
shoulders and drew himself up proudly,
&#8220;don&#8217;t forget that they are harder to come
by in the face of the enemy than here in New
York, where influence will get one, apparently,
for any jack-a-dandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care, sir,&#8221; cried an officer.</p>

<p>George smiled, flipped his hand to his hat
in a most cavalier manner and stepped briskly
away across the Parade. But through the tail
of his eye he saw a grave officer, who had just
come up, halt at the carriage before referred
to; and he also saw Peggy Camp lean forward
and whisper something to him swiftly. Then
the officer motioned a young ensign forward,
said something in turn, and the ensign made
after George with all speed. Overtaking him,
he said, politely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but I understand you are looking
for headquarters. It is just above here.
Lord Sterling requested me to show you the
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Sterling!&#8221; echoed George, and he
could not help a backward glance at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
officer who still remained beside the carriage
speaking with Peggy Camp and her friends.
Of late he had heard much of the distinguished
man who, born in New York, had
made such a great fight in the English courts
for the earldom of Sterling. He had failed
in this; but all America believed him the
rightful heir, and so called him. His service
to the colonial cause had already marked
him; and he had been created general of
brigade.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a friend to Miss Camp, I take it,&#8221;
said the ensign. But George shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, no! I thought from the interest
she took in your welfare,&#8221; with a laugh,
&#8220;that you were. And, too, she appeared
quite delighted at your brisk handling of
young Henderson. You seem to be quite
fortunate.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was considerable stir about the doorway
of the building which the ensign pointed
out as headquarters; a sentry passed them at
a word from this same obliging young officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you desire to see General Putnam in
person,&#8221; said the ensign, &#8220;you&#8217;ll first have to
see Major Hyde. And as he happens to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
our cousin to Peggy Camp, you&#8217;ll no
doubt get along famously with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The laugh that followed this sally was still
ringing in George&#8217;s ears as he crossed the
room to speak to Major Hyde, who was seated
at a big table engaged in writing. The major
was a young man of sallow complexion and
with a cold, supercilious manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; demanded he, his lip drawing back
from his fine teeth in a sneer that seemed one
of his characteristics, &#8220;what now?&#8221;</p>

<p>George resentfully slapped his dispatch bag
upon the table, being careful, however, to
keep a grip upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dispatches,&#8221; said he, bluntly, with a
salute. &#8220;From General Washington to General
Putnam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221; Major Hyde&#8217;s hand went forward
toward the packet. &#8220;I will take charge
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as the hand advanced, the packet retreated.
&#8220;My orders,&#8221; said young Prentiss,
drily, &#8220;are that these dispatches be delivered
into General Putnam&#8217;s hands only.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were several other officers seated
about the room transacting headquarters business;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
at the young man&#8217;s words they looked
up, surprised. Major Hyde sprang to his feet,
his eyes snapping with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; cried he. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
do as I bid you. Don&#8217;t forget that! I am
your superior officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am aware that you are,&#8221; replied the
young man, &#8220;but my orders from General
Washington are unmistakable, sir. And he is
your superior officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Hyde remained standing
with rage; then he sat down abruptly and
rapped upon the table for an orderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dispatches from Boston for General Putnam,&#8221;
said he shortly. &#8220;Tell him so.&#8221;</p>

<p>George stood back and awaited the soldier&#8217;s
return; and as he waited he could not help
wondering at his odd experience in New
York.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been on shore but a bare hour&mdash;scarcely
that long&mdash;and I have met with
nothing but affronts and rebuffs,&#8221; he said to
the young ensign who sat in a window overlooking
Broadway. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand
the attitude of the colonists here. At Boston,
one has but to be a patriot to meet with consideration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
But in New York, apparently, it
makes little difference what your sympathies;
you have but to be a stranger to be marked
for insolence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;New York,&#8221; said the ensign, who seemed
a person of some intelligence, &#8220;is very different
from Boston&mdash;from my own city, Philadelphia,
or from any other place in the colonies,
for the matter of that. It was settled by
mixed races&mdash;Dutch, Huguenots, English and
Scotch. Their interests, desires and ideals
have been different from the beginning.
They have become so accustomed to facing
each other down and sneering at each other&#8217;s
social peculiarities that it has, so it seems,
grown to be a part of their deportment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the speaker was about to plunge into
an elaborate discourse upon this subject, but
George was saved from listening by the
orderly reappearing from an inner room and
beckoning him forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;The general will see you,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>In another moment the young man found
himself in the presence of the stout, red-faced
Putnam who sat puzzling over some intricate
maps at a great table. Beside him sat another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
officer whom George at once recognized as
General Sullivan, and standing near by was
General Heath, who had done so much to
train the raw levies for the fight at Breed&#8217;s
Hill.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>GENERAL PUTNAM GLANCED UP</i></p>


<p>General Putnam glanced up as George
entered; his good-humored face took on a
smile, and he at once threw aside the map,
which, to speak the plain truth, did not
greatly interest him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Prentiss,&#8221; said he. &#8220;So it&#8217;s you, is
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>George saluted; drawing the packet of
sealed dispatches from his saddle-bag, he
laid them before the bluff commander. The
latter tore it open eagerly; one by one he
mastered the contents of the papers, and as
he did so, passed them on to Sullivan, who
in turn read and handed them to General
Heath.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so General Washington will be with
us within a few weeks,&#8221; said the latter, upon
finishing the last of the dispatches. &#8220;Excellent!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all we require to make the place safe,&#8221;
said Putnam. &#8220;The batteries are planted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the redoubts completed and the passes all
made good. With the main body of the
army here we can welcome the enemy at any
time he chooses to show himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The general is bringing the forces on
by way of Providence, Norwich and New
London,&#8221; spoke Sullivan, referring to one
of the papers, &#8220;and says that he will remain
with them until they are safely embarked at
the latter place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Heath and Sullivan fell into a debate
as to the probabilities of the main body&#8217;s
securing sufficient suitable craft to carry it
expeditiously from the Connecticut port to
New York; and while they were so engaged,
Putnam arose and crossed the room to where
George Prentiss was standing. In his hand
he held a slip of paper which he had not
passed on to his brother officers; and he
folded and refolded it carefully with his
strong, thick fingers, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;And so the general has made you a bearer
of his dispatches.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flush of color came into the young man&#8217;s
face, and he replied earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was proud indeed to be called upon for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
such service. I had had no thought that I
might be so trusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut,&#8221; said the kindly Putnam, &#8220;if
you made a mistake at the beginning, you
but showed that you were human. We are
all likely to do the same. All of us were at
one time or another king&#8217;s men; and if you
were somewhat late in renouncing your allegiance,
so to speak, what great matter? You
are as determined upon liberty now as the
best of us. You proved that a score of times
about Boston and Cambridge last winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am pleased that you hold so good an
opinion of me, general,&#8221; said young Prentiss,
&#8220;and, believe me, I shall try to be worthy
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand your feelings,&#8221; and Putnam
laid a big hand upon his shoulder. &#8220;So
we&#8217;ll say no more about it. And now, good-bye;
I have some matters to attend to. But
leave word with Major Hyde where you can
be found. I may want your service upon
business of importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>George saluted; and as the sturdy old
soldier turned back to the table, the young
man left the room. He inquired of the ensign,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
whom he found still at the window, as
to the inns and lodging places.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;King&#8217;s Arms&#8217; is the place for you.
It is but a step or two above; look,&#8221; pointing
from the window, &#8220;you can see its sign-board
from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanking the affable young man, George
turned to Major Hyde and gave the &#8220;King&#8217;s
Arms&#8221; as his address, after which he left the
building and took steps to install himself at
the inn.</p>

<p>It was something past high noon by this;
and as he sat at a table in the &#8220;King&#8217;s Arms&#8221;
discussing a beefsteak pie and a brown loaf,
he chanced to glance from the window near
which his table stood. Upon the opposite
side of the way stood Major Hyde and Henderson,
the foppish officer of dragoons; in
earnest conference with them was a burly
personage in a long skirted coat and having
the manner of an ill-trained mastiff. Every
now and then Hyde would punctuate his remarks
by pointing at the inn, and each time
the little, fierce, deep-set eyes of the burly
man would follow the gesture with satisfaction.
After some moments, during which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
George observed all three closely, they appeared
to come to some sort of understanding.
The burly personage, after assuring them of
something, at once crossed the street toward
the &#8220;King&#8217;s Arms.&#8221;</p>

<small>TELLS HOW A BULLY ENTERED THE<br />
&#8220;KING&#8217;S ARMS&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were sundry other patrons of the
&#8220;King&#8217;s Arms&#8221; gathered in the public room
at the time, dining on the wholesome food for
which the inn was noted. There were officers
of the colonial army; there were, also, citizens
of the town, who, judging from their discourse,
were of various political complexions;
and, also, there were many smartly attired
ladies of apparent consequence.</p>

<p>The peppery Lee and his successor in command
of New York had shown a marvelously
short temper in their dealings with the more
vigorous of the Tories; but for all that there
were many of them left in the town, and, too,
they were not of the sort that keep a still
tongue to gain favor.</p>

<p>Indeed, as he listened to the conversation
going on upon all sides, young Prentiss was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
greatly astonished. Round about Boston, the
king&#8217;s men had not dared to express themselves
since Boston fight; but here they not
only proclaimed their views, but the patriots
listened patiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is because the matter has not progressed
so rapidly here as in Boston,&#8221; he reasoned
with himself. &#8220;The king&#8217;s army is not strong
enough to take the initiative&mdash;and the friends
of liberty have not yet abandoned hope of
patching up matters with the ministers at
London.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very near to George, one of these discussions
was fast gathering volume, but, as his breakfast
on board the &#8220;Nancy Breen&#8221; had been
of the slimmest, he gave more attention to his
dinner than to the dispute. But gradually,
as the voices grew in sternness, the young
fellow noticed something familiar in them;
so turning his head he recognized Merchant
Camp, his partner Dana, and the heavy-faced
young militiaman, Camp&#8217;s nephew.</p>

<p>The old Tory merchant, a napkin tucked
about his neck, was flourishing his fork and
airing his opinions with much relish. He
sat directly facing his nephew, and seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
be scorching him with sarcasm and his private
version of the facts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep to your opinions, if you style them
as such,&#8221; he was saying. &#8220;You are only a
lad and I will not quarrel with you because
of them. But, as sure as the sun shines at
this moment, there will be wreck and ruin
for many because of the loose thinking of you
and the like of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put down the fork carefully upon his
plate and now shook his finger beneath the
sullen young man&#8217;s nose, while he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Because your party has forced a handful
of king&#8217;s troops to keep behind the walls of
the fort&mdash;because you have taken the government&#8217;s
cannon with none to prevent you, you
must needs fancy yourselves great fellows, indeed.
And because the king&#8217;s frigates do not
open upon you, you think it is because they
fear you. Bah, sir, bah! I never credited
reasoning creatures with so little sense. The
reason why the garrison remains quiet&mdash;the
reason why Lee and Putnam were permitted
to seize the guns&mdash;the reason why the frigates
below there have withheld their broadsides,
is because they are biding their time. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
answer will yet come, never fear; and when
it does, trust His Majesty&#8217;s officers to make it
full and complete.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heavy-browed young man shook his
head, stubbornly, and looked more sullen
than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are awaiting reinforcements,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;We all know that. But what difference
does it make? Let them come. By the
time they get here, General Washington will
also have arrived with the American army.
He drove the British out of Boston, and he&#8217;ll
drive them out of New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He drove them out of Boston&mdash;I grant
you that. But it was because vigorous measures
had not been taken in the first place.
Gage was too lenient&mdash;too easily gulled. He
did not dream that British subjects would
ever take up arms against their sovereign.
But here it is different. Howe knows the
full measure of this treason, and he should
come prepared to cope with it. He&#8217;ll be provided
with fleets and armies and equipment;
and no doubt he&#8217;ll have his instructions as to
how to act. It&#8217;ll not be the case of Gage over
again. Trust the king&#8217;s ministers for that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
And another thing,&#8221; here the old man&#8217;s voice
was pitched a key lower, &#8220;in the colony of
New York, your brave Washington and his
fellows will have a different people to deal
with. The countryside will not be with him
as in Massachusetts. There will be thousands
of loyal gentlemen; and besides, there will be
the Johnson family.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the lowered voice, the words
were caught by those seated close by; and
George Prentiss noticed that every one near
paused and looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah! Those Johnsons!&#8221; grumbled a
gentleman of undoubted Dutch extraction at
the table at George&#8217;s right. &#8220;A dangerous
set of rascals, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I may make bold, sir,&#8221; asked the young
man, &#8220;to whom does he refer?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pursy gentleman looked astonished at
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible,&#8221; said he thickly, &#8220;that there
is any one who does not know of Sir William
Johnson, once His Majesty&#8217;s Indian agent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is he not now dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but his descendants still live,&#8221; complained
the other, his broad Dutch face full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
of indignation. &#8220;Sir William made vast
wealth in his office; he was almost actual
sovereign of the Six Nations. His family
have all his riches and all his power over
the Indians, and they threaten to bring the
tomahawks upon us if we persist in our demands
for justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>George could not help a shudder at this;
that the British might resort to the Indians
to help their cause had never occurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, uncle,&#8221; demanded the heavy-browed
young man, &#8220;do you approve of so barbarous
a method of putting down the popular will
as Guy Johnson or Colonel Claus could
supply?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Camp was seized with a fit of
coughing; that he did not approve of it was
plain enough; but he was not the man to
give an opponent in debate the slightest advantage.
It was Mr. Dana who next spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Far be it from any of us to desire bloodshed
of whatsoever kind,&#8221; said he. &#8220;For my
part, I fervently hope that the misguided
people of these provinces will shortly see
their error, and abide by what the law plainly
requires them to do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Here the sullen young man laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be blood letting and plenty of
it, never fear,&#8221; exclaimed he. &#8220;The Sons of
Liberty will never give a step in their demands;
and England&#8217;s present ministers are
not of the sort to let a rich prize slip from
them without a struggle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should they?&#8221; demanded Mr.
Camp in a high voice. &#8220;Why should they,
nephew? These colonies cost men&#8217;s lives and
much treasure to acquire, and why should the
government not defend them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he plunged into an angry defense of
any action that the ministry might take; his
voice was so unguarded and his manner so
violent that the waiters went scurrying here
and there; and finally the landlord himself approached
hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must beg of you, Mr. Camp,&#8221; suggested
he in a smooth voice, &#8220;that you moderate
your language. You are giving offense to my
guests, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as though the
short-tempered old king&#8217;s man was about to
flare forth as he had upon the wharf earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
in the day. But a remembrance of what had
followed that outburst, perhaps, deterred him.
He waved his hand, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; I had forgotten. I ask your
pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Highly gratified at quelling a possible disturbance
so easily, the landlord was about to
turn away when a voice bellowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, a place&mdash;a place! Must I be
kept waiting as though my money were not
as good as another&#8217;s? Get me a place, blockhead,
or I&#8217;ll see what cudgeling will do for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A frightened little man in a huge apron
fluttered about somewhat helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a place,&#8221; said he, drawing back
his chair at a table in a shadowy corner.
&#8220;And a very good place, too, sir. Much to be
desired, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll tempt me to lay my stick over
your back yet,&#8221; bellowed the impatient guest.
&#8220;What sort of a situation is that for a man
of my quality? A fitting place for a dog to
curl up, but not for a gentleman to eat his
dinner in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This way, sir,&#8221; interposed the host, much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
in haste, for complaint was distasteful to him.
&#8220;This way. Here is a place well lighted and
well aired,&#8221; and he drew out a chair at
George&#8217;s table. &#8220;The young gentleman will
not object, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; and he bowed to George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; said George, and as he
spoke he glanced up. At once he recognized
in the noisy, ill-tempered guest the burly
personage whom he had seen a few minutes
before in conference with Major Hyde and the
dragoon officer, across the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Object!&#8221; said the big man in a harsh
voice. &#8220;Object! Why should he, I&#8217;d like to
know? This is a public inn, and I think I
know my rights in such a place.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, he slapped his dusty beaver hat
upon the table and sat down facing George
with noisy ostentation. There was something
deliberately offensive in the man&#8217;s manner,
and George darted a sharp look at him,
though he said nothing. The newcomer
noted the look, and thrusting his head forward
inquired, bluntly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have nothing to say, I trust, young
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In my turn,&#8221; replied young Prentiss,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
quietly, &#8220;I trust that I shall have no occasion
to say anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>The burly man did not seem to know how
to take this; but evidently he suspected some
hidden meaning in the saying, for his little
eyes began to snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I make it a point to pay as I go, and ask
favors of no one,&#8221; declared he. &#8220;What have
you to say to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good resolution, as such things
run,&#8221; returned the youth. &#8220;But, believe me,
sir, I can do very well without the particulars
as to your private affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The burly personage was taken somewhat
aback at this, and his surprise was so evident
that several persons who had been listening
laughed outright. Among these was Herbert
Camp, and instantly the big man selected
him from the others and whirled round in
his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, sir,&#8221; said he, with much directness,
&#8220;that you are not laughing at my
expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sullen-faced lieutenant flushed as he
saw the eyes of all within hearing turn upon
him. But he answered readily enough:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;I would be very sorry, indeed, to do anything
at your expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, would you so?&#8221; and the man eyed
him with singular intentness. &#8220;Well,&#8221; with
a nod of the head, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bear you in mind, my
lad. It is possible that I&#8217;ll make some small
effort in your direction before a very great
while.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the time that he had seen his neighbor
in conference with Major Hyde and the
officer of dragoons and had caught their
gestures, George had had no doubt but the
man&#8217;s intentions in entering the &#8220;King&#8217;s
Arms&#8221; was in some way connected with himself.
He had given both officers offense
during the morning, and he had felt that
the burly one&#8217;s errand was some scheme of
retaliation.</p>

<p>The offensive manner of the man toward
him seemed to clinch this belief; but now,
as George went sedately on with his dinner,
all the time observing his neighbor, his suspicions
gradually changed. The newcomer
paid no further attention to him; indeed, for
all the knowledge he betrayed of his presence,
young Prentiss might as well not have existed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>This seemed odd to George and piqued his
interest; he was still speculating upon its
meaning, when he made a peculiar discovery.
The man before him sat, as stated, with his
arms folded across his chest; his eyes had
also closed, and a casual observer would have
pronounced him fallen into a doze. But
several little things pointed out the real facts
to George. The big man was intently listening
to the conversation which had been resumed
at Mr. Camp&#8217;s table.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>TELLS HOW THE BULLY CHANGED HIS MIND AND<br />
HOW GEORGE WAS SENT FOR IN HASTE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> discovery, as may well be imagined,
increased the interest which George Prentiss
felt in his surroundings; the aspect of his ill-mannered,
loud-mouthed table companion
immediately underwent a change. From a
hired bully, the fellow was at once transformed
into something more subtle&mdash;a spy&mdash;a
creature whose employment was as underhand
as his appearance was blunt. But what made
the occasion more surprising than anything
else was that the spy was, apparently, in the
pay of Major Hyde&mdash;and the object of his
surveillance was perhaps the major&#8217;s uncle.</p>

<p>And so as the burly man listened to the
conversation at Mr. Camp&#8217;s table, George
listened also, proceeding leisurely with his
dinner, and always keeping his eyes upon the
face opposite him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Mr. Camp still clung to the political situation
as a subject for remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother will be arrayed against brother,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and father against son. The separations
and heart burnings will be dreadful to
think about, for it is really civil war that
these rogues seek to bring upon us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Mr. Dana, earnestly, &#8220;would it
not be well to wait until matters are further
developed before prophesying evil?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Camp grew irate at this. &#8220;Hah!&#8221;
cried he. &#8220;Let me assure you, sir, that it
requires no prophet here. The things that I
speak of have already come to pass. My
nephew Robert Hyde has gone over to the
enemies of the king, as you know. And I
ask you to look at Harry here. What uniform
does he wear? They have poisoned him
also with their doctrines; nothing will do
him but that the king&#8217;s officers be taken by
the scruff of the neck and bundled on board
ship, never to return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gentleman must always follow the
dictates of his conscience,&#8221; returned Harry.
&#8220;Yours leads you to support the king&mdash;mine
impels me in other directions.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Impel is a very good word,&#8221; commented
Merchant Camp, addressing Dana. &#8220;I could
not pick one that described it better if I tried.
But,&#8221; and he turned to Herbert, &#8220;look you,
young man. You are not the only one that
feels the impulse of change. It has occurred
to me many times of late that my will also
needs a bit of altering.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a brief moment George, who had turned
his head, saw Herbert Camp&#8217;s face go blank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, as to&mdash;as to a mere matter of
money,&#8221; stammered Herbert, obviously endeavoring
to make his voice ring angrily,
&#8220;that can have no effect upon a person of
honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a trifle like sixty thousand pounds,
mark you,&#8221; said the old Tory to Dana.
&#8220;They hold themselves high, these patriots.&#8221;
And once more addressing himself to Herbert,
he continued: &#8220;Do you recall that some days
ago I asked you to change the color of your
coat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; replied the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a week, I think, that I gave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good. There are a couple of days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
yet to go. So consider the matter well.
Change your coat, or I change my will.&#8221;</p>

<p>George felt the table shake; the big man
had twitched spasmodically, and his knees
had knocked against its legs. Young Prentiss
flashed him a searching look; but in no
other way did the bully manifest interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your money is your own to do what you
please with,&#8221; said Herbert Camp to his uncle,
but for all his effort, there was a certain
waver in his voice and tones. &#8220;And you
would not have me sink my principle to get
it, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure not, nephew,&#8221; said the old
gentleman. &#8220;But be assured of this: My
money will never go to any one who upholds
the rebel cause. I would not buy your allegiance,
nor that of any other person; but the
facts are as I have stated them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nephew drummed upon the edge of
the table with his finger-tips. Things were
at this stage when a waiter approached, bearing
the burly man&#8217;s dinner; this he placed
before him with care, then shook him
gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your dinner, sir,&#8221; suggested the waiter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
not without some caution. The burly man
opened his little eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I see it. And I&#8217;ll
warrant it has no more seasoning than a
brindle cow&#8217;s milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the waiter hastened to reassure him
upon this point; and so the man began to eat
with an appetite but with much muttering
and complaining. The conversation continued
at the Camp table, the youth Herbert
rather weakly maintaining his position, and
his uncle proclaiming his fixity of purpose.
But the spy took no more notice of them or
their sayings. Strangely enough, as George
Prentiss thought, he had lost all interest in
them.</p>

<p>Indeed, even when they had finished their
meal and their discussion and arisen to their
feet, he did not lift his head. But old Camp&#8217;s
nephew, apparently in an ill-humor, did not
forget him. The youth in turning stumbled
across one of the man&#8217;s legs, which were needlessly
sprawled out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said the young man, tartly,
after recovering himself, &#8220;this is the recognition
which you just now promised me&mdash;trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to dash out my brains among the inn furniture.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked up at him insolently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I promise you anything?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did, sir,&#8221; replied the lieutenant, paying
no heed to Mr. Dana&#8217;s plucking at his
sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;sometimes little
things happen which prevent our keeping
promises hurriedly made.&#8221; There was something
like a laugh in his voice as he added,
&#8220;Perhaps some such little thing has happened
since I spoke to you last, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young militiaman grew very indignant
at this and seemed about to make a heated
rejoinder; however, the two merchants pushed
him on ahead of them.</p>

<p>They had paid the reckoning and left the
inn; and George was examining his own score,
when the burly man suddenly lifted a hand
and called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, this way, sir, this way!&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Hyde, his dark face full of eagerness,
approached; and at his heels was the foppish
dragoon, Henderson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just now saw them leave,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
major. &#8220;Did you find an opportunity,
Slade?&#8221;</p>

<p>The burly man shrugged his lumpy shoulders
carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; answered he. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t difficult.
But I let it pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; and there was a note of
menace in Hyde&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you call that living up to a contract?&#8221;
asked Henderson. &#8220;Seems like downright
neglect to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no occasion to follow out your
plan,&#8221; said Slade. &#8220;I have lived by quarrels
these many years,&#8221; with a laugh, &#8220;but for all
that, I don&#8217;t believe in them much unless
they are necessary. I had your young blade
fast enough and could have had it out with
him very nicely. But as it turned out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Major Hyde noted George for the first
time and instantly his gesture stopped Slade&#8217;s
mouth. Affecting a careless laugh, although
all the time there was an evil look upon his
face, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, it makes no great difference,
either way. It was but a stupid sort of jest
to say the best of it. At another time, we&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
have our laugh out to the full. But come,
let us be going. I have some business to see
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have but begun my dinner,&#8221; said Slade
in protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinners,&#8221; spoke the major, &#8220;can be had
at any time; but these affairs of mine must
not be kept waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>With much complaint Slade left the table,
casting longing looks at the smoking dishes
thereon. They had reached the door of the
public room as George arose and began readjusting
his shoulder belt, of which he had
freed himself when he sat down. He saw
Hyde lean toward Slade and say something
in a low tone; then he noted the latter&#8217;s
quick, furtive, over-the-shoulder look in his
direction; after this they passed out, and he
could see them through the window, walking
arm in arm down Broadway, their heads very
close together.</p>

<p>When George in his turn left the &#8220;King&#8217;s
Arms&#8221; he was busily revolving what he had
seen and heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has an odd look,&#8221; mused he. &#8220;And I
don&#8217;t just get the meaning of it all. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
can be no doubt that Major Hyde sent
this man into the inn for a purpose. But
what was this purpose? Hyde&#8217;s words might
lead one to believe that it was the carrying
out of some sort of idle jest. But I doubt
that. He gave that turn to the matter only
when he recognized me, and felt that I had
overheard what he had said.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly he walked along Broadway past Wall
Street and the English Church, still going
over the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first words that Hyde said to Slade
upon entering were: &#8216;Did you find your
opportunity?&#8217; And Slade answered that he
had, but had let it pass. Then he said he&#8217;d
found there was no occasion to follow Hyde&#8217;s
plans, and that he had heard something&mdash;&mdash;Now
the only thing which he heard that
seemed to greatly interest him was that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the young man&#8217;s muttering stopped;
his thoughts took a wild leap; for a moment
or two they were a jumble of extravagances;
then order began to reappear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Camp, it seems, is enormously rich,&#8221;
was the new train of thought. &#8220;Major Hyde
is his nephew, as is also this young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
called Herbert. And Herbert, apparently,
was to be the heir; a thing which was distasteful
to Major Hyde. So the major sent
this bully who sat at table with me to pick
a quarrel with the lucky nephew. A duel
would perhaps have been the result; and the
course of the old man&#8217;s money shifted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the bully proved a man of cunning
as well as ferocity. When he heard that
Herbert would likely be disinherited because
of his political leanings, he saw that the fight
would be unnecessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, however, the chain of reasoning
showed a missing link.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Herbert is to be disinherited for holding
to the cause of the colonies,&#8221; George
asked himself &#8220;how can Major Hyde, who
also advocates that cause, hope to replace
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed to unsettle the foundation of
all that had gone before, and he shook his
head more puzzled than ever. But in a moment
or two he put the entire matter aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I am bothering about
the interests of strangers,&#8221; said he, impatiently.
He had about dismissed the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
from his mind and was looking curiously at
some of the quaint old Dutch houses still
standing when there came a beat of hoofs
upon the stones of the road; and the horseman
drew up beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well caught, Mr. Prentiss,&#8221; laughed
the horseman, jovially. &#8220;I asked for you at
the &#8216;King&#8217;s Arms,&#8217; and they told me that you
had just gone. So I took the liberty of guessing
which direction you had taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the ensign with whom George had
previously spoken; he rode a strong-looking
gray horse which chafed at the bit and pawed
nervously at the ground. The ensign had
struck young Prentiss from the first as being
a likable sort of fellow, and so he greeted him
in friendly fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had not been gone from headquarters
above an hour when General Putnam asked
for you,&#8221; said the rider. &#8220;Major Hyde had
left some time before, and none would have
known where you were to be found had I not
happened to be still lounging about. And
so,&#8221; with a laugh, &#8220;here I am to take you
back with me in all haste.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>IN WHICH GENERAL PUTNAM HAS HIS SAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">It</span> is a matter of importance, then?&#8221; said
George, as he walked along at the horse&#8217;s side,
his face now pointed in the direction of the
fort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hazard that it is of unusual
importance,&#8221; returned the ensign; &#8220;though I
have not the faintest knowledge of its nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes&#8217; brisk traveling and they
reached the headquarters; George was at once
admitted to the room where he had previously
spoken to General Putnam.</p>

<p>The latter was still there, as was General
Sullivan, and with them was an artillery
captain who was talking volubly and with
much excitement. But as George entered
he ceased, at a sign from General Putnam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prentiss,&#8221; said Putnam, after a moment&#8217;s
pause, during which he studied the young
New Englander carefully, &#8220;I have several
times had occasion to benefit by your service in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
somewhat venturesome matters. And now,&#8221;
here he bent forward a trifle, his hands upon
the table in front of him, &#8220;that an occasion
has arisen, I can offer you another service,
which while it may not prove dangerous,
seems sufficiently interesting to occupy a
youth of your inches for some little time.
Would you care to undertake it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you think it necessary that the thing
be done is enough for me,&#8221; replied George.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is an excellent answer,&#8221; said Putnam,
his big, round face beaming. &#8220;There are, no
doubt,&#8221; he proceeded, and he glanced at
General Sullivan as though in explanation,
&#8220;numbers of young men in every branch of
the service here in New York who could
bring this matter to a highly successful issue.
But as I am not acquainted with their individual
merits, I might make a sad mistake
in trying to select the proper one. Here,&#8221;
and he nodded toward George, &#8220;is one of
whom I have personal knowledge. That is
why I have preferred him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others signified that the reason appealed
to them as being a perfectly just one.</p>

<p>There was a short pause. General Putnam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
seemed to be marshaling his thoughts together;
then he said, addressing George:</p>

<p>&#8220;New York has been most difficult to
control in the present crisis; there were many
Tories about Boston, but here they number
fully half the population. And their numbers
make them dangerous. We have seized upon
the persons of the most aggressive of them;
but in spite of this a steady opposition continues
to be made to everything we do. If
this were openly done, it would be a simple
matter. But it is carried on secretly. Information
of some of our most intimate designs,
so we have discovered, is regularly had by our
enemies. Our troops are being corrupted;
our stores and magazines are in real danger
of destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of late this Tory system seems to have
selected our posts upon the Highlands for
especial attention,&#8221; proceeded Putnam, and
the artillery officer pursed his lips and
wrinkled his brow as though in agreement.
&#8220;Nothing, mind you, is definitely known,
but there is a feeling among us all that our
work is in some way being steadily undermined.
Recruiting has been brought almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
to a standstill because we have become convinced
that many of those offering themselves
have other motives than the preservation of
our liberties.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day Captain Hall unearthed some
traces of what might possibly be a plot. But
I am sorry to say that what he has discovered
is not of sufficient directness to warrant our
arresting any one. However, it affords us a
most excellent beginning for a counter system
of espionage; and that is what we have concluded
to organize. It is well at first, though,
to make no ornate attempts upon them; a
modest beginning may bring much better
results.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact that you are unknown in these
parts is of some value,&#8221; spoke General
Sullivan.</p>

<p>Putnam nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we have learned shows that stranger
recruits are more apt to be approached by the
secret agents of the Tories than those known
in New York and of settled local convictions,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;And that, as General Sullivan
wisely remarks, has value. What we propose
is that you make your way to Harlem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Heights, say to-morrow, spend a day or two
in idling about in a desultory, unattached sort
of way. Then go through the form of enlistment
with Captain Hall, here, and after that
follow up any track that circumstance leads
you upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have any facts for me,&#8221; said George,
&#8220;I will take them now; and to-morrow I will
do as you suggest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These papers,&#8221; said General Putnam, taking
up a slim packet, &#8220;contain all the information
that we have upon the subject. Take
them into that room,&#8221; pointing to a small
inner apartment, &#8220;and study them. But
commit nothing to writing that might betray
you, if found.&#8221;</p>

<p>George took the packet and entered the
room indicated; seating himself at a window
he began to examine the writings, document
by document.</p>

<p>However, they yielded no great amount of
data, being largely the names of suspected
persons and their places of resort. Carefully
he read down the list, thinking to come upon
something that would give him a handhold.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sloop &#8216;Shark,&#8217; Nathan Parks, master,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
suspected of carrying information to the
British frigates,&#8221; met his eye without much
meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Corporal Bacon of the artillery, thought
to be in the pay of the Loyalists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thomas Friend, a peddler, and said to be
a spy in the pay of Governor Colden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ann Jane Trout, landlady of the &#8216;Wheat
Sheaf,&#8217; an inn long suspected of being the
gathering place of the enemies of popular
rights.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Wheat Sheaf,&#8217;&#8221; said George, his
mind at once focusing upon this name.
&#8220;That is the place that Merchant Dana
directed me to.&#8221; He gazed reflectively at the
paper for a moment and gradually a smile
came into his face. &#8220;At nine to-morrow
night he specified, I think. I had not
thought to go there; but now,&#8221; and here
the smile grew broader and a sparkle began
to dance in his eyes, &#8220;well, now it promises
to be different, for something may be gained
by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Earnestly he scanned the documents.
Traces of suspected plots were recorded,
especially the one which Captain Hall had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
come upon the day before. For the most
part they seemed the stories of imaginative
persons, lacking all the vital points of convincing
evidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; mused George, &#8220;where there is
much smoke, there may be some fire.&#8221; He
retied the papers and arising, went into the
other room where he laid them upon the
table before General Putnam, who was now
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready,&#8221; announced he, in reply to
the officer&#8217;s mute inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lad,&#8221; said the general, heartily;
&#8220;to-morrow, then, you make a beginning.
I&#8217;ll have a sum of money sent you to-morrow
at your lodgings, for you&#8217;ll have some small
expenses, no doubt. And now, good luck.
Do your best.&#8221;</p>

<p>George saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may trust me for that, sir,&#8221; said he.
And then he went out.</p>

<small>EXPLAINS HOW GEORGE PRENTISS BECAME A<br />
GUEST AT THE &#8220;WHEAT SHEAF&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">True</span> to his word, General Putnam sent
George Prentiss a handful of gold coins next
morning and George, toward noon, engaged a
horse of the landlord which he promised to
send back by a wagoner on the day following.
Mounting, he set out up Broadway, turned
into the Bloomingdale Road, and then along
the Hudson until he came to the sharp turn to
the right which brought him into the Kingsbridge
Road not far from Burdett&#8217;s Ferry.
Directly ahead, Harlem Heights bulked
densely; to the east could be seen the wooded
sides of Mt. Morris, while from the high
shoulder of the road, an occasional glint was
to be had of the Harlem River as it slipped
along toward the Sound.</p>

<p>The young man drew up his horse at this
point and looked about him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;The reports placed the &#8216;Wheat Sheaf&#8217; at
no great distance from here,&#8221; said he to himself.
&#8220;And as it&#8217;s wearing toward evening I
may as well take my dinner there.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he sat his horse he heard the ring of a
hammer striking hearty blows upon an anvil;
then a sledge joined in and a clangor of sound
swept upward. George shook the rein, and
about fifty yards further on, in a sheltered
spot a little back from the road, he came upon
a small smithy.</p>

<p>George dismounted and stood watching the
smith and his assistant for a space; then the
iron was apparently beaten into its true shape,
for it was laid aside and the two stood mopping
their faces with damp towels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day,&#8221; greeted George.</p>

<p>&#8220;The top of it to yourself, sure,&#8221; returned
the smith, who was a freckled Irishman with
fiery red hair and a droll look.</p>

<p>&#8220;That seemed like a hard task,&#8221; commented
the young man, coming nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; returned the smith, &#8220;it&#8217;s
little else we&#8217;re getting nowadays. Since
they&#8217;ve took to fighting all about the place,
sorra the bit of work do we get but bayonets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
swords as long as your arm and bits like this,&#8221;
with a jerk of his thumb toward the still
glowing forging, &#8220;for the big guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>The apprentice, a huge limbed youth with
a small, sloping head, was observing young
Prentiss&#8217;s shoulder belt with its heavy hanger,
and the pistol butt that protruded from a
holster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you in General Putnam&#8217;s army?&#8221;
asked he, all agape.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied George, truthfully. &#8220;I am
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Small blame to him for asking you that,&#8221;
said the Irish smith, &#8220;for it&#8217;s few that go by
now but Putnam&#8217;s sogers&mdash;or the other sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other sort!&#8221; echoed George, catching
at this instantly. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you for the king or for Congress?&#8221;
asked the smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Congress,&#8221; returned George, promptly.</p>

<p>The other came forward and extended a
brawny fist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck to you, for you&#8217;re the right
stripe,&#8221; said he smiling broadly. &#8220;It&#8217;s meself
that knows but little about the Congress
beyant there and what they do be about; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
I&#8217;m hand and foot with them against the
Sassenach, no matter what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>George laughed at this frank declaration of
purpose; but instantly came back to the
matter of interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;other sort&#8217; I suppose are Tories?&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>The smith nodded. &#8220;Faith,&#8221; spoke he,
&#8220;they&#8217;re fair pisonous with the venom that&#8217;s
in them; and hereabouts they do be as thick
as the gnats in the swamps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the army being in possession prevents
them being at all dangerous,&#8221; said
George.</p>

<p>The other shook his head. &#8220;The army can
do nothing against such as these,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;You might as well put that horse of yours,
there, to catching a mole. Sorra the sound
do they make, and never a sight of themselves
do they give any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; and George smiled a little, &#8220;it
would seem that you have both heard and
seen them at some time or other.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Irishman laughed loudly at this remark.
&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;re the
shrewd felly entirely. But you&#8217;re right,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
and here he lowered his voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re
right. I see more than some; and be the
same token, I hear more than most.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded mysteriously. As there appeared
to be something gained by it, George
slipped from his mount, tied it by the door
and entered the smithy. Leaning against a
broken gun carriage, he began slowly drawing
off his gauntlets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard a great deal, in one way and
another, of the plots of the Loyalists,&#8221; said he
with an air of doubt, &#8220;but to be entirely
candid, I have seen scarcely anything in the
way of proof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Proof!&#8221; said the smith, with energy;
&#8220;it&#8217;s proof ye want, is it, me lad? Oh, well!
them that have it could supply plenty of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they come forward with it,
then?&#8221; demanded young Prentiss, bluntly.
&#8220;Why hide it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;they have
small bits of childer and are not wantin&#8217; the
houses burnt over their heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fear, then, that stops their mouths,&#8221;
stated George. &#8220;They are afraid of the king&#8217;s
men!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>He had calculated well; the Celtic ire of
the smith began to rise; his big fists doubled
up; his freckled face began to flame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid, is it!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Afraid! If
you knew them you wouldn&#8217;t say that.
When you live in a lonely place, my lad,
and have desperate enemies with revenge
in their hearts again&#8217; you, you must take
care. And when wife and childer are depending
upon the man for the bite and the
sup, he thinks twice before he puts himself in
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how is one to know that there is real
danger?&#8221; said George. &#8220;It may be that it
has no existence save in the mind of the
person who dreads it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This exasperated the blacksmith. He had
been holding himself in check with great
effort, but now he burst out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad luck to ye, is it imagining it all that
you think I&#8217;ve been doing? Is it imagination,
me son, when a man sees them with his
two eyes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Here he caught sight of the
apprentice, standing with his head thrust
forward and his mouth agape. &#8220;And have
you nothing at all to do, Peter?&#8221; he demanded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
sharply. &#8220;Away with you to Van
Tile&#8217;s and fetch the horse that he wants shod.
Stir yourself, now, or it&#8217;ll be dark again&#8217; you
get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vastly disappointed, the apprentice took
off his leather apron and departed on his
errand. Then the smith gave his attention
to George once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good, hard-working lad,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but he&#8217;s not over bright in some things, and
lets his tongue run too free when he
shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He poked his fire and threw on more fuel;
then seating himself upon the anvil, he went
on:</p>

<p>&#8220;People do imagine a good many things,&#8221;
nodding wisely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve listened to them myself
many a time. But is it imagination when
a man comes in the night, calls you to the
door, and you wide awake, pokes a lantern in
your face with one hand and a pistol with the
other and bids you hold your peace?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;Did that happen to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To no one else. And why? Because I
knew more than it was thought fitting I
should know. Because I had seen things.
Because I had heard things. Because if I
told the half of it, I&#8217;d be putting ropes about
the necks of a dozen or more.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;I WALKED INTO A NEST<br />
OF KING&#8217;S MEN&#8221;</i></p>

<p>George laughed. &#8220;More than likely it
was some sort of a rough joke that your
visitor was enjoying at your expense,&#8221; said
he.</p>

<p>Again the ire of the smith began to mount.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joke?&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Joke, is it? You
know nothing of me, me lad, or you&#8217;d be sure
no man would play the merry Andrew in
that style with me. And maybe you think,&#8221;
here he pointed one challenging finger at
George, &#8220;that it was a joke that I see carried
on that same night, only a bit earlier, at the
&#8216;Wheat Sheaf&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; asked George, allowing
quite a tone of scepticism to creep into his
voice.</p>

<p>The Celt recognized the doubtful tone, and
the warmth of his manner increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made a bit of a mistake that night,&#8221;
spoke he, trying to keep from flying into a
rage. &#8220;I opened the door to one of the private
rooms and walked into a nest of king&#8217;s
men, up to their eyes in plotting. And that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
was not all&mdash;in the midst of them was some
one that&#8217;s supposed to wear an entirely different
kind of a coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; said George, eagerly, &#8220;that
you saw engaged with the Tories one who is
known as a patriot?&#8221;</p>

<p>The interest in his voice was too plain to
escape the smith; instantly the man&#8217;s heat
vanished; all his excited desire to show that
he had real cause to fear the anger of the
conspirators disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I mean,&#8221; said he, in a greatly
altered voice, and as he spoke his eyes were
full of suspicion, &#8220;is no matter. I saw what
I saw; and if anybody wants to know the
meaning of it or the particulars of it, let him
search them out for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; demanded young Prentiss, &#8220;do you
really mean to keep important facts from the
authorities?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to try and keep a roof over my
head, and life in my body,&#8221; said the smith,
thrusting a bar of iron into the fire and beginning
to blow the coals into a higher red.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well for those in the town to
speak out boldly; but this is a lonely place;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and as I said before, a man with a wife and
childer can&#8217;t run himself into danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The return of the apprentice, leading a
plow horse by the bridle, put an end to the
talk. So George mounted and, gathering up
his reins, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Wheat Sheaf&#8217; is not very far away,
I believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A matter of a half mile,&#8221; answered the
mechanic.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll dine there, like as not,&#8221; said George.
And then he added, with a laugh: &#8220;Perhaps
it will be as well for me to keep my eyes open
also; I may see something upon my own
account.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he waved his hand in a good-bye and
set off along the road once more. The patriot
batteries mounted upon the Heights were in
view through the dusk when he sighted the
&#8220;Wheat Sheaf,&#8221; which was a large rambling
structure with a veranda upon two sides of it
and a great number of small-paned windows
through which the lights were already beginning
to glint.</p>

<p>No one was visible, and George called loudly
as he pulled up at the door:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;Ho, the house! Landlord!&#8221;</p>

<p>From somewhere in the rear, a sharp-faced
woman made her appearance. She was very
tall and angular, her movements were awkward,
and when she spoke her voice was
high.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoighty toity!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and must
we make all this noise at a decent inn? What
is your wish, young man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have some one take my horse, mistress,&#8221;
replied George, &#8220;and I desire him
rubbed and given a good feed of clean grain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman turned toward the barn and
called shrilly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Job!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had repeated the cry several times
before there was any response; then a man
came out of the barn, rubbing his eyes and
shuffling his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been asleep again,&#8221; charged the
woman. &#8220;You are the most idle, good-for-nothing
rascal in Harlem, I really believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man blinked ill-humoredly. &#8220;Fair
words, Mistress Trout,&#8221; spoke he. &#8220;They go
farther than the other sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t answer me back, you wretch,&#8221; cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Mistress Trout. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it. And you&#8217;d
better mend your ways, sir, or I&#8217;ll turn you
off; and you&#8217;ll have a time of it getting another
situation, I promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>George dismounted and gave his horse to
the hostler.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said he politely to the woman,
&#8220;that I am not putting you about; but I&#8217;d
like a snack of something, if I&#8217;m not too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed,&#8221; said Mistress Trout, &#8220;traffic
hereabouts is not so great that we have all
the victuals bespoke.&#8221; Then turning to the
hostler, who was yawning behind his hand,
she cried sharply: &#8220;Well, and are you going
to see to the gentleman&#8217;s horse, blockhead?
Or do you mean to fall asleep as you
stand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man must have sleep some time,&#8221;
growled Job, as he took the nag by the bridle.
&#8220;If I&#8217;m kept up at night, mistress, by people
that go and come at all hours, it&#8217;s little to be
wondered at if I try to catch a wink or two
by daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlady of the &#8220;Wheat Sheaf&#8221; gave
him a look full of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; said she. &#8220;You have said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
quite enough. Now, be off and attend to your
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grumbling, the man led the horse toward
the barn; and George followed Mistress Trout
into the inn. The public room into which
he was shown was huge and square and furnished
with heavy tables, settles and high-backed
chairs. There was a brick fireplace at
one side; the evening was a crisp one with a
breeze that rattled the many window frames,
and in consequence a heap of billets crackled
on the fire-dogs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have it snug enough here,&#8221; observed
George with satisfaction, as he hung his hat
upon a peg and began to remove his gloves.
&#8220;Facing the spring wind makes a small fire
seem a most comfortable thing, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a pretty penny it runs into for cut
wood,&#8221; objected the landlady. &#8220;But what is
a tavern-keeper to do when people come in
and hector and bully?&#8221;</p>

<p>There came an impatient creaking of a
settle near the fire; a head lifted up from a
leather cushion, and a voice demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not paying for all I get, madam?
Is the fire-wood not included? No, don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
say anything,&#8221; and the speaker gestured impatiently;
&#8220;put it in the bill, and don&#8217;t
worry me with your conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mistress Trout tossed her head at this, and
after receiving George&#8217;s order, left the apartment
with a wrathful countenance.</p>

<p>Curiously, George approached the fire; holding
his hands out to the blaze, he looked into
the upturned face, and to his surprise recognized
the heavy brows and sullen expression
of Lieutenant Camp. As he was still surprisedly
gazing into the young man&#8217;s face, the
eyes opened; seeing himself closely observed,
the latter sat up instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said he, rather roughly. &#8220;What
brings you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fire, latterly,&#8221; smiled George, still
holding his hands extended over the blaze.
&#8220;But the prospect of a hot supper, mainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heavy brows of the young man upon
the settle gathered in a frown; his eyes
searched George&#8217;s face with a peculiar look.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that I&#8217;ve seen you before,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>George nodded, but just as he was about to
point out where they had met on the day before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
he caught the odd look in the other&#8217;s
eyes, and with a quick impulse checked himself.
So he merely said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence; the young
man upon the settle clasped one knee with
his hands and studied George intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a stranger hereabouts, I take it,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>George nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; was his brief reply.</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. Young Prentiss,
without seeming to do so, examined the other
as intently as he was himself being examined.
And, gradually, the impression grew more
and more upon him that Merchant Camp&#8217;s
nephew was keying himself to say something
which he considered of much importance.
Several times the lieutenant bent forward and
seemed upon the point of speaking; but each
time he sank back, his lips still closed and an
expression of indecision upon his face. At
length, however, he seemed resolved to make
the plunge. With voice so lowered as to be
almost a whisper, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is rumored that Washington will soon
be here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>George stared at him; so ludicrously tame
did the saying seem after all the cautious
hesitation that had preceded it that he almost
laughed. But the expression upon
Herbert Camp&#8217;s face prevented this; it was
one of eager expectation&mdash;of almost painful
interest. A suspicion flashed upon George;
a suspicion and a fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great deal like a test&mdash;a signal by
which one person makes himself sure of another,&#8221;
he told himself.</p>

<p>Instantly he was all attention. Bending
his head courteously, he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard the rumor myself, and think
that it is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>This answer did not repel the other; but at
the same time it did not satisfy him, either.
He arose and leaning against the brick mantle
began slapping at his boot leg with a riding
whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way are you traveling?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;North,&#8221; returned George.</p>

<p>The face of the other grew brighter. He
endeavored to assume a light manner, and
laughed a little as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you think that there will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
more to interest you in that direction than in
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One usually travels in the direction in
which one&#8217;s interest lies,&#8221; replied young
Prentiss in the same tone. &#8220;And I am like
most in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert Camp nodded and pondered. For
a few moments he stood alternately glancing
at George and then toward the window; the
lash of the whip continued to cut at his boot
leg and to lay long welts upon the sanded floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You came alone?&#8221; asked he, finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it somewhat dangerous to take the
north road unaccompanied?&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Prentiss smiled. &#8220;You did not
seem to think so,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;With me it is different,&#8221; spoke the lieutenant
with a meaning in his voice that
George did not grasp. &#8220;But for strangers the
way is unprotected. Did you meet no one
upon the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is strange. Though, as I said, it&#8217;s a
lonely way, still one is apt to meet a peddler
now and then.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>George noted a peculiar stress upon the last
part of the sentence, and his mind began to
cast about for its meaning. Almost instantly
he caught it, and self-control alone prevented
his exclaiming aloud. The papers given him
to examine by General Putnam had named
one Thomas Friend, a peddler, as a suspected
person. Was Lieutenant Camp, in his guarded
utterance, referring to this man? Like lightning
George&#8217;s mind was made up; and with
a calm voice and a careless manner he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I came upon no peddlers to-day; but,&#8221;
and he fixed his eyes steadily upon the other&#8217;s
face, &#8220;peddlers are merchants of small degree,
perhaps, and I had a visit yesterday from a
merchant aboard ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>Recollection instantly swept into the lieutenant&#8217;s
face; dropping his whip he brought
his palms together with a smack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I remember where I saw you. It
was on the wharf near &#8216;The Brigantine&#8217; inn.
I am glad indeed to meet you!&#8221; He seized
George&#8217;s hand and shook it energetically;
then he added, eagerly: &#8220;It was Dana who
told you to come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>George nodded; he was afraid to do more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
not yet being sure of his ground. Young
Camp sat down upon the settle and roared
with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder,&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t
grasp my meaning readily. I thought it
was Tom Friend, the peddler, who was to
bring you here. By Jove, how you stared
and winked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The owl,&#8221; said George, &#8220;does a lot of
staring and blinking. And it&#8217;s reckoned a
wise bird for no other reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; said Lieutenant Camp. &#8220;Right!
What you did, you did well. I have no fault
to find with you; the only hitch has been in
my misinformation. I wonder,&#8221; said he, &#8220;just
how that came about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; replied George, slowly, &#8220;it
chances that old men are erratic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Camp slapped his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I never gave a
thought to that; and now you mention it, I
have no doubt that is what&#8217;s to blame in this
case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here a waiter, under the personal direction
of Mistress Trout, entered bearing George&#8217;s
supper, smoking hot and very savory and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
tempting. It was placed upon a table near
the fire, which had been laid with a clean
cloth, much white napery, and shining table
ware. With great satisfaction, George sat
down to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said he to the lieutenant, &#8220;that
you&#8217;ll join me. Dining alone is sometimes a
tiresome business.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the other gestured in the negative.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had just finished when you rode up,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Pray go on, and pay no attention
to me in that respect.&#8221;</p>

<p>George did as he was bidden; and he had
already made considerable inroad upon the
hot dishes from Mistress Trout&#8217;s kitchen when
Herbert Camp spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought,&#8221; said the latter,
&#8220;that you would have come here as soon as
you got ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As it is,&#8221; returned George, &#8220;I am hours
before my time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then a time was named?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>The other leaned back upon the settle and
shielded his face from the fire; George&#8217;s
efforts upon the logs had not been without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
effect, for the blaze was now brisk and high;
the sparks shot up the wide chimney in
showers.</p>

<p>&#8220;At half after nine, I think,&#8221; said Lieutenant Camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;At nine exactly,&#8221; returned George.</p>

<p>The lieutenant here fell back into a long
silence. He shielded his face from the heat
with his hat and sat looking at the darting
sparks as they leaped upward. George, as he
proceeded with his dinner, watched him; the
face was deeply shadowed by the upheld hat,
but the young soldier&#8217;s attitude was full of
meaning, the changing lights in his eyes spoke
of a mind not at rest.</p>

<p>As he watched him George recalled old
Merchant Camp&#8217;s words of the day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;But look you, young man,&#8221; he had said,
&#8220;you are not the only one that feels the impulse
of change. It has occurred to me many
times of late that my will needs a bit of altering,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Distinctly young Prentiss recalled the blank
look that crossed Herbert Camp&#8217;s face at this
saying. True, he had stammered something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
about a mere matter of money having no
effect upon a person of honor.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; was the thought that crossed
George&#8217;s mind, &#8220;the protest was rather weak.
&#8216;Change your coat, or I change my will&#8217; was
old Camp&#8217;s next saying, and the young man&#8217;s
answer to this was more wavering still.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Tory had also said that there still
remained a few days more to effect the change
he desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it would seem,&#8221; thought the young
New Englander, indignantly, &#8220;that he&#8217;ll get
his wish. This young man spoke of principle
yesterday; it seems that he&#8217;s thought better
of it to-day. Sixty thousand pounds has been
too great a lure to resist; his greed was greater
than his patriotism.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, despite his indignation, he went
calmly on with his meal; and while he ate,
Herbert Camp continued in the same attitude,
apparently thinking deeply. Both were engaged
in this way when there came a bustle
from the road before the inn; glancing
through the window, which was on line with
his table, he saw in the light of several
lanterns a queer looking man mounted upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
a tall, bony horse and carrying before him a
huge pack. Both Mistress Trout and the
hostler, Job, had gone out to receive the newcomer,
who slid awkwardly from his pad-saddle,
dragging his pack along with him.</p>

<p>From his gestures, George saw that the
man was making quite a speech regarding
the caretaking of his bony nag; Job listened
with great patience, and led the animal carefully
to the barn when its owner had done.
Then the man, staggering under the pack,
followed the landlady to the inn.</p>

<p>Into the public room he shambled; depositing
his burden in a corner he stood erect,
his breath coming in deep gasps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time was,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when I could have
borne that load and not made half the ado.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a square-built, stocky man, with
thick, bowed legs and a partially bald head.
He had prominent outstanding ears and tremendous
hands, corded and knotted like those
of a giant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do very well as it is, sir,&#8221; spoke
the landlady. &#8220;There&#8217;s scarce a man in
Harlem that could carry so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man mopped his bald head with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
yellow handkerchief and laughed. &#8220;Ah,
good lady,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be seeking to
get the better of me in a trade before I&#8217;m
gone. Sweet words mean only one thing to
a man of my business&mdash;they seek to take the
place of halfpence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, then,&#8221; cried Mistress Trout, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have no trading with you. I have no time to
haggle, and no use for your goods.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that she whisked angularly from
the room, leaving the newcomer in a broad
grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; declared he with great gusto, &#8220;is
not that like a woman in every way? &#8216;I
have no use for your goods,&#8217; says she&mdash;and
never a sight has she of what I have to offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>This speech he directed at George, who
nodded good-naturedly; the man then put
his great thumbs in the armholes of his
waistcoat and proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;But women folk are ever hard to trade
with, sir; thirty years have I ridden these
roads with a pack before me, and that is one
of the things which I have learned. They
have no judgment; caprice rules them;
they&#8217;ll bargain for hours over a staple article<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
of known value, and then squander their
shilling without a word on trash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are harsh, I think, sir,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; returned the peddler, &#8220;that I am
not. I know them. Thirty years on the
road has taught me something.&#8221; Here he
approached the fire. &#8220;By your leave, sir,&#8221;
said he to the lieutenant, and sat down upon
an end of the settle. The lieutenant nodded
curtly and gave him little direct attention.
But out of the tail of his eye he observed the
peddler narrowly, as George did not fail to
observe.</p>

<p>The stranger crossed his thick, bowed legs
and held his hands out to the fire with much
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is still a tang in the air,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Winter is not quite gone, even yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned George, &#8220;and further north,
it is colder still.&#8221;</p>

<p>The saying was entirely unpremeditated;
but instantly he realized that it bore an
apparent significance, for the peddler shot
him a glance of surprise, and then coughed
in a warning way behind his hand. Then,
as though to cover an awkward happening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
the man thrust a thumb and forefinger into
his waistcoat pocket and produced a massive
watch. Holding it up that George might
have a good view of it, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a rare sight for you; I dare
venture to say you don&#8217;t often see its like.
The king puts no finer gold in his guineas,
and the cogs and springs and balances are
miracles of art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks very fine, indeed,&#8221; praised George.</p>

<p>&#8220;I offer such rarities only to certain gentlemen
of quality,&#8221; said the peddler; &#8220;but,&#8221; and
he made a wide gesture, &#8220;things are not what
they were, and I am scantily furnished with
money just now.&#8221; He bent toward George.
&#8220;If you fancy such a thing you shall have it
at a small price.&#8221;</p>

<p>But George shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you examined it well?&#8221; The peddler
got up and stood with his broad back
to the lieutenant, his head lowered toward
George and his face away from the firelight.
&#8220;It is a surprising watch in more ways than
one. Look; could anything be finer?&#8221; So
saying he snapped open the heavy case and
bent still nearer to the young New Englander.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Then his voice sank lower and he whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;What ship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Nancy Breen,&#8217;&#8221; in the same tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the other,&#8221; and a twitch of a mouth
corner indicated the lieutenant, &#8220;bear you
company?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well,&#8221; said the peddler, his voice
lifting plainly, and his manner that of a man
rebuffed. &#8220;If you have no need of it, why,
then, all&#8217;s said and done.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying he stuffed the watch into his
pocket, rebuttoned the flap, sat down upon
his end of the settle once more and began
staring fixedly into the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; spoke Lieutenant Camp, after
a few moments of silence, &#8220;that you pick up
many quaint and curious things in your journeyings
here and there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The peddler gave him no very tolerant look
and replied, shortly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, that I do, sir.&#8221; Then with a bending
of his brows and a shake of his bald head,
he continued: &#8220;But I always make shift to
mind my own business, young sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>The lieutenant sat up stiff upon the settle.
&#8220;Do you mean to infer that I do not, my
man?&#8221; demanded he.</p>

<p>The peddler turned squarely upon him and
looked him in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not aware that I called you by
name, sir,&#8221; said he pointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not having a name to call me by,&#8221; said
the lieutenant, &#8220;it would be a difficult thing
to do. But, perhaps, if I gave you one, you&#8217;d
be more civil.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stooped and spoke a word or two in the
ear of the peddler; and instantly the latter&#8217;s
dogged look vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; exclaimed he in friendly
fashion, &#8220;who&#8217;d have dreamed it! Who&#8217;d
have dreamed it!&#8221; He struck the oaken
settle a resounding blow with the heel of his
hand. &#8220;We&#8217;re coming on, sir; we&#8217;re coming
on mightily!&#8221;</p>

<p>He beamed genially upon the young men,
and seemed quite delighted; and just as he
seemed upon the point of launching upon
matters that George thought might prove
most interesting, there came a clatter of hoofs
from the road and the jingle of chains and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
military equipment. The face lost its cheerful
look as a voice gave an unintelligible,
grumbled order; heavy feet tramped up the
path and upon the porch; then the door was
flung open and a party of armed men in the
colonial buff and blue thronged into the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>TELLS HOW THREE PEOPLE MADE A DASH FOR
FREEDOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> leader of the colonials was a tall man
with wide, sloping shoulders and a harsh
face. He had quick, eager eyes that snapped
inquiringly and questioned everything upon
which they rested.</p>

<p>Halting his men in the center of the public
room, he surveyed its three occupants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your position and consequence, gentlemen?&#8221;
said he. &#8220;And how is it that you
are here to-night and not at your homes?&#8221;</p>

<p>The peddler chuckled and cracked the great
fingers of each hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;A person of my station, sir,&#8221; he made answer,
&#8220;is at home wherever night overtakes
him. I am by occupation a peddler, selling
honest stuffs and asking ready silver in exchange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name?&#8221; demanded the officer, and
his eager eyes snapped more than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thomas Friend.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Watching the officer&#8217;s face, George saw it
change grimly at this answer; he made no
remark, but turning to Herbert Camp, inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;And how is it with you, my lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Bardwell,&#8221; returned the
young man, composedly. &#8220;I suppose, sir,&#8221;
with a glance at the party of soldiers, &#8220;that
you have a right to make these inquiries?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; replied the officer, &#8220;that I have;
and I&#8217;m not called upon to show any credentials,
either. This uniform will do all that,&#8221;
and he slapped himself upon the chest, &#8220;and
so out with the rest of it. What are you,
and what is your errand here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am clerk to a mercer in the city,&#8221; replied
young Camp&mdash;&#8220;Mr. Nathan in Maiden
Lane, to be exact. And I&#8217;m on my way beyond
the Harlem upon some matters of business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could have gotten beyond the Harlem
if you had had the mind,&#8221; spoke the leader
of the party, positively. &#8220;There was no reason
for your stopping here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dislike traveling at night,&#8221; said the
other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;Then you should have started earlier in
the day.&#8221; And with this the officer turned
upon George. &#8220;And you, sir?&#8221; he demanded,
peremptorily. &#8220;What have you to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am from Cambridge,&#8221; replied George.
&#8220;I arrived in New York only recently and
am traveling about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You selected a most indifferent time and
place to do it in,&#8221; the other made answer.
Then with a gesture that took in all three he
added: &#8220;You are under arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert Camp was upon his feet instantly.
George fancied he saw his face paling.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; asked young Camp. &#8220;You
have no right to interfere with inoffensive
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if I know them to be such,&#8221; replied
the officer, and he laughed harshly. &#8220;But
my orders are to take all suspicious characters
in charge. This man,&#8221; and he pointed to the
peddler, &#8220;I have orders to take wherever and
whenever found. You two,&#8221; and his snapping
eyes shot glances at the two young men,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take charge of for further examination.
I have no desire to inflict hardship upon
you,&#8221; with something like an apologetic note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
in his voice, &#8220;but these are troublesome times,
and we have suffered a great deal through
secret agencies. If you are what you claim
to be, you will be put to as little disadvantage
as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he made a sign to his men; they
immediately approached the three guests of
the &#8220;Wheat Sheaf&#8221; and laid hands upon
them. But if they expected unresisting submission,
they reckoned without the spirit of
the strong-limbed peddler. With a sweep of
his arms he dashed the troopers aside; then
with remarkable agility he bounded to a window;
there was a smashing of glass, a rending
of wood, and he was gone. Several muskets
flashed after him, their reports sounding
like thunder in the low ceilinged room.</p>

<p>A soldier had apparently been left to guard
the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; he cried as his charges began to
stamp with fear of the musket shots.</p>

<p>Then there came a racing of hoofs and the
sound of a discharging pistol. At the command
of their officer, some of the soldiers
rushed out after him; the remainder seized
upon George and Herbert Camp roughly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
their arms were pinioned in an instant with
a couple of stout leather belts.</p>

<p>There was a roar of firearms, and hoarse,
excited shouts sounded from the darkness;
then nags were evidently mounted in haste;
the rattle of hoofs sounded as the riders
plunged away in pursuit. But that all had
not started in the chase was soon made plain.
Voices, loud and interrogatory, came from
without. Apparently some one made answer;
but the answer was not of the sort to satisfy,
for again the voices chorused their inquiries.
The reply to this was also unsatisfactory and
still inaudible to those in the public room.
Then came the sound of heavy steps upon the
porch; in the hall there was a slight scuffle
and then the slope-shouldered officer entered.
And after him two of his men led between
them&mdash;Peggy Camp!</p>

<p>A cry of astonishment broke from the lips
of her brother, while George Prentiss gave a
gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy!&#8221; exclaimed young Camp.</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes mutely commanded him to
be still; but the eager-eyed officer caught the
look.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;Too late,&#8221; laughed he. &#8220;The young man
is evidently not accustomed to surprises.&#8221;
His gaze went from Herbert to the girl with
great enjoyment. &#8220;And so,&#8221; said he to the
young man, &#8220;you are acquainted with this
lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Camp made no reply; Peggy stood
stiffly upright with her chin tilted proudly,
an expression of scorn in her eyes; and she
also was silent when the man turned his
glance upon her once more.</p>

<p>But for all her pride of bearing, for all her
scorn of her captor, George noted a small
tremble of the lower lip; it were as though
her restraint would goat any moment and the
tears begin to flow. And as he watched he
saw the resentment in her eyes now
and then give place to something else. It
was fear; the shivering fear of one who is
helpless.</p>

<p>The officer addressed her. &#8220;It may be,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;that you can explain your presence
outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I could,&#8221; she returned, and if
there was fear in her eyes, there was no trace
of it in her voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;It would be somewhat interesting to hear
your reasons for lurking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be equally interesting to hear
your reasons for treating me as you have
done,&#8221; answered Peggy, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that, I have my orders,&#8221; and the
man laughed, not without good nature. &#8220;And
in the face of what has just now occurred, I
am bound to be even more strict than ever in
carrying them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the officer questioned and the girl
answered, her glances went here and there
about the room like those of a hunted thing
seeking a way of escape. The eyes of George
Prentiss closely followed after; but they saw
things that her startled glances passed over.</p>

<p>He noted four muskets stacked near a
window. These belonged to the men who
had pinioned Herbert Camp and himself.
The men who had brought Peggy into the
room each held one.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they,&#8221; reflected George, &#8220;were fired
after the peddler, and have not been reloaded.
The same is true of the pistol in the belt of
the officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Also he noted something which Peggy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
could not see. This was that the belt which
held his arms behind him had begun to slip;
he felt that at any moment he desired he could
free himself from it.</p>

<p>He found himself thrilling at the thought.
His entrance into the &#8220;Wheat Sheaf&#8221; had put
him upon the track of a promising Tory plot,
the coming of the soldiers had all but ruined
his chances of getting to the bottom of it; but
now hope sprang up once more. If he could
help Herbert Camp to escape from the colonials,
he felt that he&#8217;d have even more
chance than before to sound the plot, whatever
its nature, to the bottom.</p>

<p>Mistress Trout, the man Job, and all the
other inn servants had been greatly put about
by the events of the last half hour. As the
worst seemed over, they had ventured into
the public room and stood listening with
much attention to what was being said. The
landlady at length took courage; at first this
found expression in low-voiced but acid comments
upon the proceedings; but when the
officer turned to his men and gave orders that
the prisoners be removed, she broke out:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a disgrace and a shame, sir, that an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
inn that has been respected for forty years
must be invaded this way, and its guests
carried off like common thieves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer favored her with no very friendly
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps if your inn had not been respected
for so long, mistress,&#8221; said he, &#8220;things
would be in a better way for us all. As for
these,&#8221; and he pointed to George and Herbert
Camp, &#8220;perhaps common thieves would be
far less dangerous to the public good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you hint that I would harbor
such!&#8221; stormed Mistress Trout. &#8220;How dare
you, sir! Oh, things have come to a pretty
pass, indeed, when honest people must submit
to insult from a parcel of upstarts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard words, landlady!&#8221; said the officer
sternly. &#8220;You had better put them in your
pocket, for you are not so trusted as to be
greatly in favor. You are known to have
given house-room to plotting king&#8217;s men these
many weeks back; indeed, there&#8217;s not been
such another nest of rascals in all the country
round about&mdash;and that&#8217;s saying a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The angular Mistress Trout was about to
reply, and Herbert Camp and Peggy were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
being led from the room, when George
Prentiss suddenly slipped the belt from his
arms. Like a flash he whipped up the four
loaded muskets and hurled them through a
window at the back; and with a bound he
reached the door leading to the hall, flung
aside the two soldiers who had charge of
Peggy and her brother, slapped the door in
their faces, slipped a bolt into place and went
racing down the hall. He drew the girl
along with him, and young Camp was hard
at his heels.</p>

<p>In the light of the inn&#8217;s outside lamp he
drew his hanger, of which they had not deprived
him, and slashed Herbert&#8217;s bonds
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The horses!&#8221; he breathed; &#8220;it&#8217;s our only
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had counted upon the horses of the
remaining troopers being still outside, and
probably unguarded. And in this he was
right; there stood the troop in a line, the
bridles cast loosely over the hitching-posts.
Lightly, George tossed Peggy upon the back
of one of these, while Herbert leaped upon
another. The young New Englander was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the saddle instantly, and casting loose the
other horses, with shouts and blows, sent
them scattering down the road.</p>

<p>All this only occupied a few moments;
and those few moments the soldiers wasted in
endeavoring to force the door which George
had bolted in their faces. Their officer was
the first to recover his wits, and with excited
shouts he drove them to the windows. Out
they came, leaping like so many jacks-in-the-box;
but the escaping three were already
mounted, had given their nags rein and were
speeding along the dark road. In a fury the
officer drew his pistol and snapped it; the
two soldiers followed his example with their
muskets. But they were empty, as George
had guessed.</p>

<p>And when they had rammed fresh charges
home, the flying trio were beyond range.
Indeed the sound of the horses&#8217; hoofs had
almost died away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>TELLS HOW PEGGY GAVE A WARNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three horses proved to be hardy and
fleet; and they seemed to see almost perfectly
in the dark. For almost a half hour they
were kept at a free gallop, then their riders,
feeling them beginning to blow, drew them
down to a walk.</p>

<p>Turning in his saddle, George listened,
but there were no sounds of pursuit, and he
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think our little plan carried very well,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our plan!&#8221; It was Lieutenant Camp
that spoke, and his voice contained a note
of protest. &#8220;Yours, you mean; and believe
me, sir, the very cleverest that I ever saw
executed.&#8221;</p>

<p>George laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are giving me credit for a great deal
that was purely chance,&#8221; said he, lightly.
&#8220;The bolt upon the door, for instance, and
the fact that the horses were not tied fast.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
He turned to Peggy, who rode upon the other
side of him, and added: &#8220;The element of
chance is the great factor in most enterprises;
don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made some reply, but in a voice so low
that he did not catch the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;We plan as carefully as we can, we weigh
and calculate every possibility that presents
itself; and then when the time for action
arrives, some utterly unlooked-for thing
happens that brings us victory or defeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, expecting her to make some
reply to his philosophizing; but she did not
do so; steadily she sat her horse, and from
the vague outline that he had of her, he
fancied that she was looking straight ahead.
Plainly, she desired no part in the conversation.
They had kept to the Kingsbridge
Road, and now pressed south as soon as their
horses had recovered from their long gallop.
Little was now said except upon the part of
the lieutenant; he talked eagerly and largely
upon the topics of interest to Loyalists. At
another time George would have been vastly
interested in his remarks, but now he gave
them small attention.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Somehow the silence of the girl at his side
piqued him; her manner was a subtle irritation.
He took exception to her attitude
toward him; he felt that a more friendly
aspect was but his due.</p>

<p>Mile after mile fell behind them; they passed
the long bends in the road that lay just opposite
Hell Gate, and then into the straight
length near Horen&#8217;s Hook. However, they
had reached the junction of the Bloomingdale
Road below Kip&#8217;s Bay before Peggy Camp
spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, Herbert,&#8221; she said to her brother,
&#8220;we are presuming too much upon this young
gentleman&#8217;s good nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; and the lieutenant was
plainly surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have his own affairs to attend
to,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And we should not keep him
from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say now,&#8221; protested Herbert, &#8220;that
is just a trifle unfriendly, Peggy. He is going
to ride with us into town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just as Mistress Camp desires,&#8221; returned
George, distantly, and sitting very
stiffly in his saddle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;It was a mere suggestion upon my part,&#8221;
she said, and her voice was as cold as his own.
&#8220;I have no great interest either way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brother brought his horse around
until he gained her other side; and from the
way the animal reared, it was plain that its
rider was angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world ails you to-night, Peg?&#8221;
he demanded heatedly. &#8220;One would think
that you had been affronted. We all ride
together to town. There is some business to
transact.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this Peggy made no answer; but George,
though he could make her out but dimly,
knew that she was riding on with head held
high, and he also felt sure that her eyes&mdash;if
one could but have had a glimpse of them&mdash;bore
the proud look that he had seen in them
more than once before.</p>

<p>When they reached the line of defenses
that ran westward from Corlear&#8217;s Hook, a
voice challenged them out of the darkness.
Lieutenant Camp rode forward to answer; and
no sooner had he vanished than George felt
Peggy&#8217;s horse press closer to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; she said hurriedly, in a low voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
&#8220;I must beg of you not to ride into town
with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is plain that you do not,&#8221; she returned,
&#8220;or you would not be so willing to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>He considered for a moment, his eyes trying
to search her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you could make it
clear if you had the mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;But I cannot
do so. Even in warning you so far I fear
I am doing wrong. Nevertheless you have
twice been of service to me, and it&#8217;s only a poor
return to tell you that you are in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger!&#8221; He laughed a little. &#8220;In
times like these, one is constantly in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not such danger as this.&#8221; He felt
her hand touch his arm and noted that it was
trembling. &#8220;There are some dangers that a
person of courage can face and overcome. But
this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and her voice trailed away into an
unintelligible quaver.</p>

<p>George was about to make answer when
they heard the clup-clup of horses&#8217; hoofs and
the voice of Lieutenant Camp calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s well. You may come forward.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>The girl bent toward George imploringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the last time! Will you be warned
by me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I
would much prefer to go on. But to do so
would apparently worry you; and I have no
desire to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go now,&#8221; she said, eagerly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stay.
I will ride forward and explain your disappearance
as best I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wheeled his horse and rode back along
the road; pausing at a little distance he heard
the voice of Lieutenant Camp as he loudly gave
the countersign; and again as the lieutenant
made an angry exclamation. For a time
George expected that the young officer would
ride back in search of him; but this did not
happen, and in a short space he heard brother
and sister pass the sentries, and then all was
silent.</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s meaning was shadowy and mysterious;
he could not conceive, even in part,
what danger could threaten him in the city
that did not also threaten them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, not so much, by far,&#8221; he told himself.
But then in a moment came another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
thought. &#8220;It is possible,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;that
she fancies her brother&#8217;s known rank in the
American army will serve to save him; and
that I, being a stranger, would fall under
suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, still another thought upset the
preceding one.</p>

<p>&#8220;She heard me, only yesterday, declaring
that I bore dispatches from Boston to General
Putnam. That must have convinced her that
I, too, am fairly well known.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some time he sat in the saddle pondering
this puzzle but at last he gave it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter what her meaning,&#8221; he told
himself, cheerfully, &#8220;there has been no harm
in doing what she requested. It is not as
though the brother were unknown to me. I
can pick him up at any time&mdash;to-morrow
perhaps&mdash;and resume the matter just where
it was broken off to-night at the inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Riding back some little distance he found
a road that led westward and brought him to
Broadway; and then, after passing the guard,
he made his way to the &#8220;King&#8217;s Arms&#8221; and
went quietly to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>IN WHICH GEORGE PRENTISS RECEIVES AN
INVITATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning George Prentiss made his
way to General Putnam&#8217;s headquarters at the
foot of Broadway; and, as he went, there was
at first some doubt in his mind as to the kind
of a report he should make.</p>

<p>He had undertaken readily enough the
enterprise upon which he had ridden the day
before. The conspiring Tories were enemies
to the cause of liberty, and he felt no qualms
in matching them in their own style of work.
But he had not reckoned on what had taken
place. He had not expected to find his cousin
concerned in it. True, a soldier of the colonies,
who was so base as to betray the cause
in order that he might profit thereby, was
infinitely worse than any Tory.</p>

<p>&#8220;He should receive no mercy,&#8221; George told
himself with indignation. &#8220;And any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
having the cause at heart should be only too
glad to hunt him out and see him punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>But for all his realization of this, he felt no
desire to pursue and expose Herbert Camp.</p>

<p>However, he knew which way his duty
lay; and so he determinedly tramped into
headquarters and asked to see General Putnam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; cried the hearty old officer,
&#8220;what now! I had no idea that I&#8217;d see you
for days.&#8221; Then noting an expression in the
young man&#8217;s face that was not easily read, he
added: &#8220;Something has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a deal has happened,&#8221; returned
George, &#8220;and I thought it best that I make a
report to you at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with it,&#8221; invited Putnam. &#8220;I can
see that it is a matter of interest; so lose no
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon George related his adventures
of the night before; not a detail escaped the
telling, and the general listened with the
greatest interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; cried Putnam, when George had
finally finished, &#8220;here&#8217;s a surprising circumstance,
indeed. And it would seem that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
situation is made to fit you as the coat upon
your back. There is nothing for you to do
but to take up the scent that is plain before
you; and within a week, I warrant you, the
solution of it all will be in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>But George shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said he, slowly, &#8220;that I have
no keenness for the work. I felt bound in
duty to report what I had seen and heard;
but now I ask to be relieved of the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general stared at him for a moment in
wide amazement. Then the habitually jolly
look upon his face died out, and one of coldness
replaced it.</p>

<p>&#8220;When once a soldier volunteers, it is considered
that he is willing to go on until he is
directed to halt,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>George lifted his head proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, am perfectly willing to do that,
general, if commanded. But I felt that you
were not only my officer but my friend; and
that if I told you there was something which
made the duty personally distasteful, you
would release me from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Putnam regarded him earnestly for
a moment; his face gradually softened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;You are right, my lad,&#8221; spoke he, &#8220;I am
your friend. This duty, which you have so
far carried out smoothly and well, shows
itself to be of great importance; and it would
be well for us if you could continue it. To
be sure, we could arrest young Camp and the
merchant Dana at once if need be; but there
is still little or no convincing evidence, and
a thousand loopholes by which they might
escape. The proof necessary could be best
secured by you; but if you feel a real repulsion
to the work&mdash;one that you cannot readily
overcome&mdash;you may have your wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Anything
else, general, and you may command me to
any length; but not in this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the general studied him; and then a
light crossed his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I see,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This young officer
Camp&mdash;and his sister&mdash;are somehow responsible
for your change of front.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied George. &#8220;They are my
cousins&mdash;son and daughter of my mother&#8217;s
sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see, I see. And your desire to have no
further hand in the thing is perfectly natural.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Ah, well, well&mdash;the world is a queer place, indeed&mdash;a
jumble of causes and desires&mdash;of
hopes and dreads. But,&#8221; with a wave of the
hand, &#8220;that will be all now. I will replace
you in this; however, keep in touch with me&mdash;there
may be something else in which you
may prove more ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again George saluted; and as he left headquarters
he encountered Major Hyde upon
the sidewalk. Henderson bore him company;
and from the attitude of the two they were
awaiting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well met, sir,&#8221; spoke Henderson with a
friendly wave of the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my crony, Captain Henderson of
Lowney&#8217;s City troops,&#8221; said Major Hyde, indicating
the fop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have met the gentleman before,&#8221; answered
George, coldly.</p>

<p>Hyde laughed, and exhibited more geniality
of manner than George would have given
him credit for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Don&#8217;t bear
any hard feelings. Give us both a hand, and
let us make a fresh beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon my soul!&#8221; ejaculated the dragoon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
&#8220;I no more took you the other day for what
you are, than I&#8217;d have taken you for the man
in the moon.&#8221; He grasped the young New
Englander&#8217;s reluctant hand and shook it effusively.
&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyde also shook his hand, but with more
moderation.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Putnam gave us some hint of
your service,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I beg your pardon
for any shortness of manner that I may
have used toward you. You see, every day
there are persons introducing themselves at
headquarters who have nothing but presumption
to back them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said George, nettled, &#8220;you took me
for one of those, then. Why, thank you,&#8221;
with a bow; &#8220;it was extremely good of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyde laughed and clapped him upon the
back.</p>

<p>George resented the slap upon the back; he
was not the sort who took kindly to any form
of familiarity upon short acquaintance. But
these men were enlisted in the same cause;
and he felt it his place to be on a good footing
with them. So the only way his anger
manifested itself was in his stepping out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
reach of both, and drawing himself stiffly
erect.</p>

<p>But Hyde did not appear to notice his manner.
&#8220;You are quartered at the &#8216;King&#8217;s
Arms&#8217; still, I think,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>George nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very good place, as such places go,&#8221;
said Hyde. &#8220;But it is apt to stale after a little
time spent in it.&#8221; He regarded the young
New Englander in a most kindly fashion.
&#8220;Do you intend making any stay in New
York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My orders were to put myself under the
directions of General Putnam until such time
as the commander-in-chief arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyde seemed quite delighted at this. As
for Henderson, he slapped his thigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there is luck!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;I told
you, major, that something of the kind must
be so. And he&#8217;ll be just the fellow for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Major Hyde motioned for him to be quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be quite so ready,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Perhaps
Mr. Prentiss has plans of his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then turned to George once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said he, &#8220;some of us have
grown tired of tavern fare and tavern company;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
and we have engaged a house in Wall
Street, ready furnished and with a black fellow
as cook&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And such talent!&#8221; interrupted the young
dragoon, who evidently loved fine food almost
as well as he did fine clothes. &#8220;Never
was there such a cook before. In his hands
even so common an article as a joint of beef
becomes a thing almost ethereal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not go quite so far as that,&#8221; laughed
the major, &#8220;but I will say that we are circumstanced
most comfortably. There are four of
us, and there is room for one more. Henderson
and I have discussed the matter and
made up our minds that we owe you something
to make amends for a rather boorish
greeting the other day. We&#8217;d be pleased to
have you join us in this venture, and can
assure you of greater convenience than you&#8217;ll
get at an inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>But George shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be but a few days, now,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;before the main body of the army arrives;
and my employment will then be such that
I&#8217;ll not know from one day to another where
I shall be. Another thing, I have some close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
friends with the Massachusetts troops; and
shall quarter with them at such times as I
shall be disengaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, see here now,&#8221; said the foppish dragoon,
&#8220;this is most unforgiving of you, &#8217;pon
my soul it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry,&#8221; said Hyde, whose disappointment
was better tempered, but equally
keen. &#8220;We had all but counted upon you.&#8221;
He studied George for a moment, and then
added: &#8220;But you can come and dine with us
now and then, can you not? We shall be
pleased to see you at any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>At any other time George might have consented
to accept their hospitality out of sheer
good nature. But now he somehow instinctively
drew back. It may have been that his
first impression of the two men was still strong
upon him; or it may have been something
else. He did not, however, pause to work it
out; but with a bow and a polite wave of the
hand, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very kind. Some other time,
perhaps; but not to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he swung along up Broadway,
leaving them standing gazing after him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW WASHINGTON CAME TO NEW YORK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> George Prentiss told Major Hyde
and Captain Henderson that he would remain
in New York until Washington arrived with
the army from Boston, he had not reckoned
with the uncertainties of the service.</p>

<p>That very evening he was called upon to
board a swift-sailing ship to New London,
there to deliver certain important writings to
the officer in command of that division of the
army which was expected to have already
reached that point. This duty the young
New Englander performed with the promptness
native to him; and, under orders of the
authorities at New London, he rode with
other dispatches to Washington at Norwich.</p>

<p>As he dismounted from his horse before the
commander-in-chief&#8217;s headquarters, he was
greeted with a hearty:</p>

<p>&#8220;What! do we see you again, old chap?
We thought we&#8217;d lost you for a week or more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was a stalwart young man in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
a continental uniform; and beside him stood
another, sleek and pippin-faced and with a
friendly smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;The leaders of this army,&#8221; laughed the
latter, &#8220;seem to know an accomplished dispatch
bearer when they see one. It speaks
well for their discernment.&#8221;</p>

<p>George shook them both heartily by the
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not expected to see you, either. I
had heard,&#8221; to the stalwart one, &#8220;that you&#8217;d
been sent off on a recruiting expedition
through the Massachusetts towns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat Brewster nodded gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I returned only yesterday. And we had
but little success. Now that their own homes
are not threatened, the people seem to be
losing interest in the struggle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The round-faced youth smiled widely at
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t come forward,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;they&#8217;ll find themselves worse off than before.
The British are swarming over seas,
I&#8217;ve heard. The stories of the mess-rooms
have the Atlantic black with frigates and
three-deckers of the line.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s very likely not as bad as Ben paints
it,&#8221; said young Brewster, &#8220;but at the same
time there is good cause for alarm. Nothing
is known of the expedition that sailed from
Boston under Sir Henry Clinton before the
evacuation. It&#8217;s a formidable force, capable
of striking a crippling blow; and then the
army under Howe must be hovering somewhere
within easy sailing distance. To meet
this and the forces which the ministers at
London must now be fitting out against us,
General Washington must greatly increase his
force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Night and day he&#8217;s at it,&#8221; said Ben
Cooper, in high admiration; &#8220;you never saw
such a man to work. But the recruits come
in like snails. They somehow seem to dread
to leave their own states. Just as though,&#8221;
in disgust, &#8220;there were any more danger upon
one side of a boundary line than there is on
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>After George had delivered his dispatches
and dined, his brother Ezra, more astonishingly
his counterpart than ever before, broke
in upon him tumultuously. And after they
had exchanged experiences, George related<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
his queer encounters with Herbert Camp and
his sister in New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;A traitor,&#8221; said Ezra, aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no doubt about it,&#8221; said
George. &#8220;A traitor, bought by the prospects
of the old man&#8217;s fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat for a long time in silence; then
Ezra laid his hand upon his brother&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that you asked
General Putnam&#8217;s permission to withdraw.
Herbert Camp will be taken in the end, but
neither you nor I must have a hand in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>George was next day assigned, together
with his brother and two friends, to service
under General Knox in transporting the
artillery, and in this work he labored for
some days until the heavy guns of Washington&#8217;s
force were safely stowed in the vessels
that were to carry them to New York.</p>

<p>It was on April 13th that Washington
finally reached New York City. The populace
were thick in the streets and received him
with thunderous cheers. Guns were fired,
though the ammunition could be ill spared,
and a medley of colonial flags fluttered in the
breeze.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>As it happened, Tryon, the British governor,
had just arrived in the &#8220;Asia,&#8221; a huge ship
of the line, to replace Colden once more.
Mounting the ramparts of the fort he noted
the tumult of color and the seething sea of
citizens.</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; cried he, to those of his staff who
bore him company, &#8220;I did not know that I
had grown so popular with the townsfolk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rebel leader, Mr. Washington, has just
reached the city, Your Excellency,&#8221; said some
one; &#8220;and I fear that it is he whom they are
welcoming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tryon&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; sneered he,
&#8220;is it so? Well, we will shortly see how they
will welcome the cannon shots that I&#8217;ll send
about their ears. I doubt if they will then be
so overjoyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Prentiss heard this from the lips of
the young ensign who had shown him the
way to General Putnam&#8217;s headquarters a few
weeks before. This young man&#8217;s name was
Noel, and George, in his few meetings with
him, had found him to be a student of the
times and of the conspicuous figures therein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a setback for old Tryon,&#8221; laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
young Noel. &#8220;Must have jarred him quite a
bit, I&#8217;ll warrant you. But the conceit of the
wretch, to think that any community would
take a step out of its way to cheer him. What
else but an uprising could Lord North and
the rest of the king&#8217;s ministers expect, when
they appoint such as he to rule the province?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard very little of him,&#8221; said
George, &#8220;except that he is a tyrant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some ten years ago,&#8221; said the ensign
Noel, &#8220;he was made governor of North Carolina,
vice Dobbs deceased. He built a palace
at Newberne and gave entertainments that
were the talk of the province. And to pay
for all this the taxes went up by leaps and
bounds; his administration was one black
history of crime and extortion; and at last
the &#8216;Regulator&#8217; movement began that ended
in his being withdrawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And not being good enough for North
Carolina, they saddled him upon New York,&#8221;
smiled young Prentiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. But he&#8217;s not for long.&#8221;</p>

<p>A number of young militiamen were
gathered upon the Parade at the time, and
one in the group remarked to George:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;I met your friends Brewster and Cooper
to-day. And afterward, some of the Massachusetts
men fell to talking of them. Very
remarkable young men, I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have seen their share of service,&#8221; replied
George. &#8220;Brewster is from the Wyoming
region, and Cooper is his cousin, a Philadelphian.
They both got into Boston before
the Lexington fight, and there has been little
of consequence since that time that they have
not had a hand in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Ensign Noel, &#8220;that we have
as much chance in New York as you fellows
about Boston have had. So far there has
been little or no opportunity for anything
but hard work. Of course the fortifications
and the planting of batteries are necessary
things; but there is little credit in the work
save for engineer officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get your fill of fighting, Noel, before
you are many months older, or I&#8217;m
greatly mistaken,&#8221; spoke another of the party.
&#8220;And you&#8217;ll not be sorry, either, that some
effort was made in the way of fortifications.
We may need every scrap of strength that we
can muster.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The defenses planned by Lee had been for
the most part completed, some by himself,
others by Lord Sterling and General Putnam;
and the remainder began to rise like magic
under the hand of Washington.</p>

<p>These were the days of great perplexities
for the commander-in-chief. New York had
now become the grand magazine of the
colonies. He had few men to defend it
against the weighty force that England was
expected to send. Terms of enlistment were
about expiring for a great part of the troops
that had been brought from Boston; day by
day the army was growing less, and yet call
after call came to him for reinforcements
for the desperately circumstanced force in
Canada.</p>

<p>Some weeks after his assuming command
of New York, Washington set out for Philadelphia
to consult with Congress with regard
to the passage of an act that would increase
the army in a more permanent way; for he
now realized that the transient enlistment of
militia would never supply sufficient power
to effect real progress against a disciplined
enemy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Meanwhile George Prentiss, who was attached
to headquarters, had rather an idle
time of it so far as regular service went. He
did not waste his days, however; each afternoon
he rode out and inspected the roads
and outlying defenses; also he made pencil
sketches of points which he fancied would be
of value, and topographical maps of both
Manhattan and Long Island for miles around.
This sort of work came naturally to him;
more than once his officers had complimented
him upon his facility, and found its product
of considerable value.</p>

<p>One evening toward the end of May he
rode into the city with a bundle of sketches
in his saddle-bag; he had been in the district
about Kingsbridge, but had made his
way back by the roads along the East River.
Riding along Queen Street he had all but
reached the junction of Crown when he espied
a little party that crossed just ahead of him.
There was something familiar about them, so
touching his horse with the spur he turned
into Crown Street after them.</p>

<p>There was a corpulent old gentleman upon
a broad-backed Flemish mare; there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
spare old gentleman upon a rangy looking
cob; and there was a girl upon a chestnut
which champed its bit and seemed to disdain
the ground. He had not gone more than a
dozen yards into Crown Street before he
recognized those ahead of him. They were
Merchant Camp, his partner, Mr. Dana&mdash;and
Peggy.</p>

<p>Before a wide fronted brick house, not more
than a dozen yards east of William Street, the
party halted. It was undoubtedly old
Camp&#8217;s city residence, for at his call, a
couple of stout serving men hastened out
and assisted the three to dismount. The
stout old merchant gallantly led Peggy up the
steps, while Dana halted along behind them.</p>

<p>Somehow, after this, George found much to
interest him in that part of the city. The
flower gardens, just beginning to bloom, were
full of attraction; the quaint old Dutch
houses were rich in lore of times past; he
found odd, loitering fellows who could and
would talk of their neighbors; also craftsmen
who were not in the least averse to an honest
gossip while they plied their trades.</p>

<p>An old basket weaver, who sat in the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
which slanted in at his doorway while he contrived
articles of reed and cane, had lived and
worked there for forty years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Things were different when I first came,&#8221;
said he to George, and he shook his white
head in recollection of times past. &#8220;I was
young then&mdash;not yet thirty&mdash;work was plenty
and times were quieter. Good, God-fearing
folk there was then&mdash;folk that had need of
more baskets and less powder and ball.
Then people were glad to be able to do each
other a favor; now nothing will do them but
that they&#8217;ll cut one another&#8217;s throats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Times and people are always changing,&#8221;
said George, agreeably. &#8220;But riches change
folk more than anything else, perhaps,&#8221; he
philosophized. &#8220;There&#8217;s your neighbor Camp,
the merchant. He&#8217;s altered greatly in forty
years, I&#8217;ll warrant you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, not so much as you&#8217;d think,&#8221; said
the basket maker. &#8220;Except for the fact that
he prefers to live far away in the country and
gives but little of his time to his trade or his
ships, he&#8217;s much the same as he&#8217;s always
been.&#8221;</p>

<p>George laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;His hard and fast manner did not come
with age, then?&#8221; remarked he. &#8220;As a young
man he must have been a most forcible character.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old basket weaver nodded. &#8220;Always
just the same in temper,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Just as
you see him to-day. If a thing didn&#8217;t please
him, he&#8217;d storm like a fury. But he was always
good-hearted and honest; I&#8217;ll say that
for him, Tory as he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an odd thing&mdash;or so I&#8217;ve thought
sometimes&mdash;that a man&#8217;s kin are so seldom
like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a true saying,&#8221; agreed the basket
weaver, as he worked away industriously in
the sunshine. &#8220;A very true saying, young
sir. And perhaps it is even oftener the case
than you&#8217;d think. In the matter of Merchant
Camp, there are few that belong to him
that have any but a trace of his quality. Miss
Peggy is more like him than any one else.
She has his pride in full and a rare bit of his
peppery temper. But her brother is a surly
young dog. He&#8217;s a patriot, of course,&#8221; and
the old man grimaced, &#8220;but his deeds in that
way will never break him down.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he went into the army when General
Lee came, and strutted with the best of
them. But now that there is a chance of employment
against the enemy, he&#8217;s given up
his commission&mdash;resigned, they tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was news to George. True, he had
seen nothing of Herbert Camp since his return
to New York; and he had made no inquiries,
thinking it best, for one reason and
another, to put the whole episode of the
&#8220;Wheat Sheaf&#8221; behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, a man has a proper right to do
as he will,&#8221; observed the basket maker, wagging
his head. &#8220;He had his reasons, they say.
However, the matter stands as I have put it.
And since his giving up the army, little is
seen of him; once or twice I&#8217;ve noted him
pass my door, and his head was hanging like
a dog&#8217;s that had been caught harrying a rabbit
out of season.&#8221;</p>

<p>When George left the basket maker, he
rode along Crown Street and passed the Camp
mansion at a canter. By chance he lifted his
eyes to one of the windows; there stood his
cousin Peggy, an arm upraised, holding back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the curtains; and as their glances met, she
quickly let the curtain fall.</p>

<p>But that one look told him more eloquently
than words could have done that Peggy&#8217;s
mind was not at rest; there was a look of fear
in her eyes; her expression was intent and
anxious.</p>

<p>And so, day by day, as his affairs took him
through Crown Street, he never failed to look
up at the window; but not once again did he
catch sight of her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>IN WHICH GEORGE PRENTISS MAKES A SUDDEN
RESOLUTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the meantime Washington had returned
to New York. Knowing that if the British
ventured against the town, they would at
once attempt to seize the navigation of the
Hudson, he redoubled his efforts to strengthen
the defenses of that important river. Upon
his ability to hold this depended the possible
safety of the entire province.</p>

<p>Fort Montgomery was planted at the lower
part of the Highlands on a tall bluff north of
Dunderberg. Here the river was a mile wide,
and just opposite was the promontory called
Anthony&#8217;s Nose, hundreds of feet high and
accessible only to goats and men expert in
climbing. From this a body of riflemen
might sweep a vessel&#8217;s decks.</p>

<p>Fort Constitution was some miles higher
up and built upon an island. The former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
fort was garrisoned by about two hundred and
fifty of Clinton&#8217;s regiment and Wisner&#8217;s minutemen;
the latter had about half as many
drawn from the same source, and all were
about half armed and badly equipped. Colonel
James Clinton was in command of both
posts.</p>

<p>Breastworks were thrown up for the defense
of Kingsbridge and another work commanded
Spuyten Duyvil Creek. A strong
work to crown a rocky height some few miles
below the bridge was also planned; this was
to be called Fort Washington, and it would
command the channels of the Hudson; also,
redoubts were to be built on the banks at
Jeffreys Point.</p>

<p>While these efforts were being made along
the Hudson, Brooklyn was not neglected.
Here the talent of General Greene was manifested;
and in many other places works were
thrown up, batteries planted and redoubts
built.</p>

<p>And it would seem they were none too
soon; for the rumors as to the coming of a
heavy British armament were growing thicker
and thicker; some had it that the bay would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
be full of war-ships before a fortnight had
passed.</p>

<p>Governor Tryon had long before given up
the attempt to rule the province from the
point of Manhattan Island; so he undertook
the much more difficult task of transacting its
affairs from the after cabin of the &#8220;Asia,&#8221;
which was anchored in the bay. He was in
constant communication with the king&#8217;s men
of Long Island; plot upon plot was hatched
upon the ship of the line; some of them
carried, some were thwarted, but only one
made a great noise and scurrying.</p>

<p>One afternoon George was riding from
Washington&#8217;s headquarters at Richmond Hill;
along a winding path which led through Lispenard&#8217;s
meadows raced his friends Brewster
and Cooper upon horses white with foam.</p>

<p>He hurriedly drew his mount aside, for
they never slowed their pace, and as they
flashed by he saw Nat Brewster wave his
hand for him to follow. At once he wheeled
and plunged along after them. At Richmond
Hill the two dismounted, and had already
been admitted when George rode up; their
panting mounts were being led to and fro by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
an attendant; little groups of officers stood
about, conversing in low tones.</p>

<p>George slipped out of his saddle and waited;
it was perhaps a quarter of an hour later that
young Cooper, his round face running beads
of perspiration and his eyes lit with excitement,
threw open the door and came hastily
out. He carried a paper sealed with a great
splash of red wax; and his glance went
quickly about until it rested upon George.
Instantly he approached him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nat said he saw you,&#8221; stated the chubby-faced
youth, excitedly, &#8220;and that you followed us.
And it&#8217;s lucky you did, for there&#8217;s
plenty for you to do, old fellow.&#8221; He held
up the dispatch. &#8220;This is for General Sterling.&#8221;
He passed the sealed paper to George.
&#8220;Make all speed. Nat and I and some others
are going to carry the alarm to Harlem and
the posts on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alarm!&#8221; repeated young Prentiss in surprise.
Ben took a step nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;A conspiracy! Brewster was put upon it
as soon as he reached New York, and he
just got to the bottom of it this afternoon.&#8221;
Here a voice called his name from one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
windows of the mansion. &#8220;I must go,&#8221; said
he, hurriedly. &#8220;Ride hard, for moments are
precious.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Ben darted away into the house, George
threw himself into the saddle; giving his
horse rein, he galloped off toward the city.
General Lord Sterling was not to be found in
his quarters in Broadway; but at the &#8220;King&#8217;s
Arms&#8221; George discovered him engaged with
a dish of mutton chops.</p>

<p>&#8220;How now?&#8221; said the grave-faced soldier,
looking up in surprise. &#8220;You seem quite
breathless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Important news, general,&#8221; said the young
man, handing him the dispatches.</p>

<p>Neglectful of the smoking chops, Lord
Sterling broke the seal and ran his eyes
over the lines of writing. His hand struck
the table and the dishes leaped under the
impact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done!&#8221; exclaimed he. &#8220;Done at last!
Now, my fine fellows,&#8221; folding up the paper
and stowing it in the breast of his uniform
coat, &#8220;let me see you escape the net we&#8217;ll
spread for you.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_156.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap2"><i>LORD STERLING BROKE THE SEAL</i></p>

<p>Vigorously he began cutting at his meat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
but in a moment he dropped both knife and
fork, and said to George:</p>

<p>&#8220;Putnam has hinted to me that you have
had a chance to hunt out this very matter
some time ago, but that for private reasons
you gave it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>George bowed, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it seems to have made no difference.
Young Brewster has handled the thing most
cleverly. And nothing but the severest blows
would do the rascals,&#8221; continued Sterling.
&#8220;They aspire to blowing up our important
magazines, and not content with that, they
must needs have the life of the commander-in-chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask, general, what names have
been mentioned?&#8221;</p>

<p>The thought which George had been trying
to stifle all the way into the city had finally
found expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sergeant named Hickey is deep in it.
You have seen him, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frequently. He was a deserter from the
British, I think, and was used to drill our
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the very fellow. More than likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
his desertion was a blind; he was probably
sent to take service with us so that he could
try his hand at corrupting our soldiers, as he
has been doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David Matthews, Tory mayor of the city,
has been distributing money to enlist men
and purchase arms. A number of General
Washington&#8217;s body-guard is mentioned and
will be seized as soon as the word is given.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Sterling paused for a moment, and
then continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is still another person suspected.
However, he has been very careful and little
has been found against him. And he is, perhaps,
more to be feared than any of the
others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has his name ever been upon our list of
officers?&#8221; asked George, and his voice sounded
strangely in his own ears.</p>

<p>The general looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not thought you had gone so far
into the matter,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And while I can
mention no names, it is very likely the person
you have in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night, at the place where they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
quartered, George had a brief talk with Nat
Brewster, who had just ridden in from the
Highlands, and was eating a hasty supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will give you the details later,&#8221; said
Nat, &#8220;but the main facts are these: I intercepted
some letters passing between Mayor
Matthews at his place in Flatbush, and Governor
Tryon on board the &#8216;Asia&#8217;; and in this
way secured the vital facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw any documents richer in facts.
They were full of allusions which proved
most valuable to me. I recall one in particular
which put me on a surprising scent. It
said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t hesitate to trust the young man
I spoke of to the full. He is a nephew of
Camp&#8217;s, and as he has proven trustworthy in
the past, will no doubt continue to be so in
the future.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it known when they will be arrested?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The present home of Mayor Matthews is
no great distance from General Greene&#8217;s camp
on Long Island. His house is to be surrounded
to-night, and he is to be taken. We
expect to arrest the other actors in the conspiracy,
also, to-night. They are to meet at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Corbie&#8217;s tavern, which lies just to the west of
Bayard&#8217;s woods; perhaps we&#8217;ll have the good
fortune to capture them in a body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat had time to tell but little more; for
instantly upon finishing his meal, he ran out
and mounted a fresh horse, which had been
saddled for him, and rode off toward Richmond
Hill.</p>

<p>For some time after he had gone, George
sat upon a bench at an open window and
stared out at the June night. The boy&#8217;s
mind was full of vague trouble; there was
something that stirred him strangely. Dully,
he realized that it all concerned the prospective
arrest of young Camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is a traitor,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;He
deliberately broke his solemn oath to the colonies
that he might be enriched with his
uncle&#8217;s money. He is my cousin, but that
he is to be shamed and made to suffer is just
and right.&#8221;</p>

<p>But then there was Peggy. She had loved
her brother and she no doubt continued to
love him; she would also suffer, keenly,
bitterly, pitifully. George realized that to
the full.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;Girls always grieve and break their hearts
over a weakling who has done evil and is made
to pay,&#8221; he muttered, as he clasped his knees
and stared out into the darkness. &#8220;And the
nearer and dearer the criminal is to them, the
greater the grief.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Herbert Camp was near and dear to
his sister had been made evident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she not ride after him on that night
at the &#8216;Wheat Sheaf,&#8217;&#8221; he said, &#8220;fearing that
he would come to harm? And since then
what has she not suffered, perhaps, because
of him&mdash;in forebodings, in fear that he would
be found out? For all I know, she has ridden
after him more than once since, in the hope
of safeguarding him. It may be that even to-night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a flash he was upon his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter!&#8221; he called, sharply. &#8220;Peter.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thick-set fellow, showing his Dutch descent
plainly, lumbered into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you call?&#8221; he inquired, stolidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My horse&mdash;put the saddle on him as
quickly as you can and bring him around to
the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grumbling to himself, Peter quitted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
apartment. George adjusted his shoulder belt
with its steel hilted hanger; also, he looked
sharply to the priming of a pistol which he
stuck into his belt; then he paced the floor,
waiting for his mount.</p>

<p>The horse&#8217;s iron shoes rang upon the stones;
and in a few moments George was in the
saddle once more and headed away toward
Bayard&#8217;s woods.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>TELLS HOW TWO PEOPLE PEERED THROUGH THE<br />
WINDOW OF THE OLD MILL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night was without moon or stars, but
the low, coppery sky made things distinguishable,
and the horse ridden by George Prentiss
had no difficulty in maintaining a steady
lope.</p>

<p>Once outside the city proper, the rider
struck across the meadows, knowing that
Bayard&#8217;s woods were no great distance from
Washington&#8217;s headquarters. Entering a path
that skirted the wood, he pushed along until
he saw the glow of lights through a growth
of heavy trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be the tavern,&#8221; said George.
&#8220;For none but a public house would have so
many candles burning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quietly he rode forward; suddenly his horse
snorted and reared; only a good seat and a
firm hand saved the young New Englander
from a fall. His keen eyes, by this time well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
accustomed to the semi-darkness, saw a dark
shadow flit across his path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he called, and his right hand
clutched the pistol butt, &#8220;take care, there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The unknown made no answer; and the
rustling of the thick, spring growth showed
that no pause was made. George held in his
nervous horse, his eyes searching his surroundings
as best they could. But the shadow
had disappeared into the thicker ones beyond,
and all was silence.</p>

<p>The lad did not waste any time in search,
but speaking to his mount, headed toward the
lights of the tavern. Upon the side by
which he approached, the land lay low; then
the path ascended a knoll, and upon the top
of this was a building.</p>

<p>When he had gained the summit of the
rise, George recognized that the building was
a mill; its solid outline and broken wings
showed it to be, perhaps, still another reminder
of the Dutch who had held the land
in years gone by.</p>

<p>Here the young New Englander dismounted
and tied his horse.</p>

<p>He had taken to the path once more and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
had gone but half a dozen yards, when he
suddenly came to a stand. Listening intently,
he caught the scuff-scuff of advancing footsteps.
Straining his eyes, he dimly made out
two figures, arm in arm, and approaching
with great caution.</p>

<p>Instinctively young Prentiss shrank back
into the shadow of the mill wall; then he
waited until the two came up. They were
almost abreast of him when they paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the place,&#8221; spoke one, in a voice
strange to the listener. &#8220;We can talk inside
here without danger of being observed or
overheard. Many&#8217;s the time I&#8217;ve transacted
risky business here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more they advanced, apparently directly
toward the lurking figure against the
wall; a hand was outstretched, so it seemed
to George, to grasp him; but in reality it was
to open a door close beside him. The rusty
hinges creaked and complained querulously;
then the two passed into the mill and the
door closed after them.</p>

<p>George waited for a few moments, then he
stole to the door. With his ear close against
it, he detected the clink of a steel against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
flint, then through the long seams that now
showed between the warped boards of the
door he caught the gleam of the spark.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve lighted a candle,&#8221; he murmured
to himself.</p>

<p>There was a window some dozen feet above
the ground; and he was gazing up at it
speculatively when he noticed the shoots of a
sturdy vine playing back and forth in the
square of light.</p>

<p>Carefully he took hold of this and began
to draw himself upward; inch by inch he
ascended until finally his head rose above the
level of the window. Securing a good foot-hold
in a tough fork of the stem, George
settled himself to observe what was before
him. The room was a fairly large one, having
once upon a time been used for a storeroom
by the miller for his grist. A candle end
sputtered fitfully upon the head of an upturned
cask; and beside it sat two figures engaged in
earnest conversation.</p>

<p>Looking down at them as he was, George
had no very plain view of their faces; but
their words came distinctly enough to his
ears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; spoke the voice which he had
heard a few minutes before, &#8220;I had known of
your willingness some time ago. You would
have been very useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may still be so,&#8221; replied the second
person, and young Prentiss started and
barely managed to choke back the exclamation
that arose to his lips. The speaker was
Herbert Camp!</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the first man. &#8220;Our plans
are now complete. Nothing remains but
to await the moment when the signal is
given.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when will that be?&#8221; inquired Camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I to answer that?&#8221; said the
other man. &#8220;I know very little of anything
except the danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t tell you the important things,
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only those that they must. There are
men among them that are not half&mdash;no,
not a tenth as much concerned as I am;
and yet they have the details at their fingers&#8217;
ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would seem to me that you are not
well treated, Hickey,&#8221; said Herbert Camp.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>In the uncertain candle-light George now
recognized the uniform of Washington&#8217;s guard
which the second man was wearing; he had
seen the British deserter only a few times,
but, now that he was called to mind, the
watching youth had no doubt that this was he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you, or anybody else, ever hear of
Tryon treating those that serve him decently?&#8221;
demanded Hickey. &#8220;He&#8217;s one of
the sort that squeeze you dry&mdash;and then
drop you. But,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;when he&#8217;s
made up his mind to drop me, my pockets
will be well lined, for if he does not give me
his confidence, he does give me his money.&#8221;
Once more the deserter laughed.</p>

<p>What answer Herbert made, young Prentiss
did not hear; but in a moment the other
began speaking again.</p>

<p>&#8220;When old Dana recommended you to
me, I naturally had my doubts. &#8216;Is he to
be trusted?&#8217; asks I. &#8216;As you&#8217;d trust yourself,&#8217;
says he. &#8216;Are you sure of that?&#8217; says I.
&#8216;As sure as I am of anything,&#8217; says he. &#8216;It
means sixty thousand pounds to him in ready
money, real property and some of the finest
ships that sail the sea. Oh, yes, you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
trust him to any length; he&#8217;ll not miss a
fortune like that,&#8217; says he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more would any man,&#8221; answered
Herbert Camp.</p>

<p>The remainder of the reply was lost to
George; for at the moment Camp began
speaking, a sound outside the mill came
to the ears of the young New Englander.
He drew his head down out of the lighted
square of the window and listened. But
nothing followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been the horse stamping,&#8221;
was George&#8217;s thought, after a few moments.
He was about to resume his former position
when he caught the soft fall of feet almost
directly below him; and while he crouched
low, listening, he felt the vine shaking as
though under an inquiring hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one is coming up,&#8221; he breathed.
And, sure enough, the stout vine shook and
strained under an additional weight; slowly
and with much more difficulty than he had
had, George felt the unknown ascend. For a
moment he fancied that he had been discovered
and that the newcomer was swarming
up the vine to seize upon him. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
hand went to the pistol in the belt, and he
awaited the first hostile word or touch to
draw it for use.</p>

<p>The window was rather a large one, and
the point that George had gained, through
pure chance, was to the extreme left of it.
And now it also chanced that the newcomer
scaled to the right; in the darkness a head
came even with the young man, and, indeed,
passed him.</p>

<p>With his feet, knees and left hand holding
to the thick stem of the vine, George hung,
clutching the pistol butt and awaiting the
moment to act. But, so it seemed, the
stranger had more interest within the mill
than without, for the head went cautiously
above the window&#8217;s edge, the dim yellow rays
fell upon the face, and with a sharp gasp,
George recognized Peggy Camp!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>IN WHICH PEGGY CAMP SHOWS HER COURAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment, George Prentiss was so
startled that he almost slipped his hold on
the vine. But apparently Peggy took no
notice, her interest in the two in the room
below was so great; the dim rays of the candle
were reflected in her eager eyes.</p>

<p>Though George, owing to his position,
could not see the deserter and his companion,
their voices were so pitched that
he had no difficulty in hearing their conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cause of the colonies attracted me,&#8221;
he caught from young Camp. &#8220;It was the
romance of it, no doubt; and partly it was
the spirit of rebellion that every young man
feels against the powers that be. But when
my uncle made it so plain to me that it was
against my interest to continue as a colonial
officer, why, I did not hesitate an instant.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>A fist struck the cask head and the flickering
candle leaped and almost went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that is what I call reason, well
spoken,&#8221; declared Hickey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Dana must have told you my opinions
of these things,&#8221; said young Camp, &#8220;so there
is no need of my repeating them. My object
in coming here to-night was to offer my services
in any way that you might be able to
use me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that,&#8221; replied the other, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know. There are others to be considered beside
myself, you see. But,&#8221; here his voice
fell into a much lower key and finally trailed
off into a soft whispering which continued for
some time. Then Herbert Camp was heard
to say, emphatically:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will do that it is all that I can ask
in reason. Come,&#8221; and the pushing back of
stools told that the two had risen, &#8220;let us go
at once. I believe in making haste in things
of this sort, for the opportunity does not always
last.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a low-voiced reply from the
deserter; then the light went out and the
dimly illumined square of the window vanished.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Once more the neglected hinges
creaked, then the door closed, and footsteps
went stumbling away toward the tavern.</p>

<p>And now Peggy Camp began to descend the
vine; in reaching out to take a fresh hold,
she slipped and would probably have fallen
had not a firm hand caught and held her. A
frightened little cry came to her lips; but a
voice, almost in her ear, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be alarmed; I am a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the words were unheeded; the terror
of a presence so near to her and so unsuspected
overcame all else; she swung herself down to
the ground with the celerity of fear, and
George, when he had also descended, found
her gone. For a moment he stood trying to
pierce the gloom in all directions; then a now
familiar sound came to him&mdash;the rasping,
complaining squeak of neglected hinges. A
few steps brought him to the door through
which he had first seen the candle-light;
slipping within, he closed it behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once more,&#8221; said he, calmly, &#8220;I ask you
not to be alarmed. You have no occasion for
it.&#8221; With the deftness that comes of experience
he kindled a blaze; the candle end was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
still in its place upon the upturned cask, and
lighting this, he looked about him.</p>

<p>Peggy stood a dozen feet away, her eyes
fixed steadily upon him; the tilt of her chin
and the proud pose of her young body told as
plainly as words could have done that though
she might be well-nigh sick with terror, still
she would not show it. George regarded her
for a moment or two in silence; then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancied that I would find you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; flashed she, &#8220;was sure that you
would be at no great distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in her manner and
voice that affected him unpleasantly; he felt
his face flush hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; was all that he could find
to say in return. &#8220;And may I ask why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Peggy, coldly, &#8220;there are
underhand things being planned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It so happens, now and then,&#8221; said he at
last, and rather lamely, &#8220;that one is forced to
contend with such conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forced!&#8221; Her eyes flashed scornfully as
she caught the word up. &#8220;It seems, sir, that
you are a trifle disingenuous. Your choice is
free in the matter, I should think.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>He snuffed the long wick of the candle
with his fingers; in the heightened light he
looked at her with attention. And as he
looked, his wits slowly returned. He resented
the scorn so plain in her dark eyes; his anger
grew at the contempt written so straightforwardly
in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; was his thought, &#8220;and for no
other purpose in the world but that she may
be kept from danger; and she goes out of
her way to treat me as though I were some
scurvy rascal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, aloud, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That I chose to be abroad upon another
night, as you will perhaps recall, served certain
people well. Who knows but that another
such occasion might now arise; for,
unless I am mistaken, the conditions are
much alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard her breath intaken sharply at
this; and when she answered, her voice shook
a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I quite understand,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you don&#8217;t understand
what happened at that other time, or what
may happen to-night?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;As to that other night,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was
puzzled at first. But later, I came to understand.
I saw that the matter had not gone
far enough to serve your purpose, and you
desired to learn more than you knew. Then,&#8221;
and she flashed him a look of contempt, &#8220;they
might seize upon my brother and welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made no reply, though she paused for
one. After a moment she proceeded, but in
an altered tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you spoke of to-night. What did
you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that the conditions are not unlike.
Your brother is here, in secret; and you have
followed him&mdash;also in secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the rest&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and his gigantic
shadow mimicked him much as Hickey&#8217;s had
done a little while before.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I would not venture
to prophesy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not require you to do that,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I merely ask you to tell what you know.&#8221;
She came a step nearer to him and her head
bent forward, as she continued: &#8220;That night
at the &#8216;Wheat Sheaf&#8217; a party of colonial soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
showed themselves. Will it be the same
to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated; like lightning she seized
upon this as an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You have seen to
that. Such as you are always to be depended
upon to arrange their traps cleverly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes now fairly burned with scorn;
her gesture, as she shrank back from him, was
one of repulsion. And it was this gesture
that goaded him beyond endurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have laid no trap!&#8221; he answered; &#8220;and
I have not been a party to the laying of one.
I do not expect you to believe me, for I see
that you have made up your mind to think
the worst of me. But even if I were seeking
to snare your brother, would I be anything
like as false as he?&#8221; She seemed about to
make answer, but he waved it back. &#8220;I, at
least, would be working for truth and the
cause I&#8217;d sworn to uphold, while he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her laughter interrupted him. &#8220;You!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;You working for truth! You
upholding a cause because you had sworn to
do so!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty that he kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
back the bitter words that came to his lips;
but he felt that his resentment had already
caused him to go too far. So he remained
silent.</p>

<p>She stood looking at him as though expecting
him to reply; but as he did not do so, she
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you have overheard my brother
just now, you think there is nothing to be
said in his defense. But you are wrong.
There is this. No matter what his words
may have been,&#8221; and again she bent toward
him, &#8220;he is as free of wrong as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>George was about to make a reply, when
suddenly there came a smothered crash of
shots from some little distance away, mingled
with excited shouts and cries of pain. Instantly
he threw the door open, and as he ran
out he was aware that Peggy had extinguished
the candle. The tavern was a bedlam of
sound; rapid shots were being exchanged
within.</p>

<p>Through the open windows and doors of
the building men were springing, followed by
others who were grappling with them and
bearing them to the ground. But one, an active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and speedy runner, gained the outside
without mishap and raced away from the inn,
a half dozen pursuers at his heels. With a
leap of the heart George knew him as Herbert
Camp, and though he wanted to have nothing
to do with his taking, duty was plain before
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a self-confessed traitor,&#8221; muttered
the youth, &#8220;and I am bound to bring him
down if I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the tavern lights behind him, young
Camp could be made out with more or less
plainness; and he was headed directly toward
the abandoned mill. As he drew near, George
Prentiss gathered himself for an effort; the
scattering slugs from the heavy pistols of
those in pursuit sputtered and hummed about
him, but he did not flinch. The fugitive had
reached a point a dozen yards away when the
young New Englander made his contemplated
rush. However, he had not gone more than
a few steps when he felt his foot grasped
strongly; and down he went at full length
upon the ground.</p>

<p>What followed was rather confused; a half
dozen or more colonials ran by and over him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
A few paused to drag him to his feet and disarm
him. Then he heard Nat Brewster&#8217;s
voice call out:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone inside here; the door&#8217;s barred.
Get something to force it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lights sprang up and danced upon the stone
walls of the mill; a heavy log thundered
upon the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was she that tripped me,&#8221; thought
George. &#8220;And she&#8217;s hurried her brother inside,
thinking to escape notice. But they are
trapped.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door fell in with a crash, and Nat
leaped over the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Empty!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;See, there is another
door!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was&mdash;one that had escaped
George&#8217;s notice, but which Peggy had
evidently observed. And while they stood
staring at it, the sudden rattle of hoofs told
the patriots that their man had made good
his escape.</p>

<small>SHOWS HOW THE BRITISH SHIPS CAME INTO
THE BAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a few words from his friends, George
Prentiss was released; but Hickey and some
others who had been taken were marched to
a place of security and put under guard.</p>

<p>Next day all was in a turmoil; the Tories
in and about the city feared for their lives.
As Nat Brewster had predicted, Matthews, the
mayor of New York, was arrested by a detachment
of Greene&#8217;s brigade; his house and
person were searched, but no incriminating
papers were found. Those of the Tories who
had prepared for an outbreak fled, upon learning
that their leaders had been taken.</p>

<p>Washington struck swiftly and strongly;
those of the plotters who belonged to the
army were at once brought before a courtmartial;
the others were handed over to the
civic power. Of the members of the general&#8217;s
guard taken, only Hickey was convicted; he
was promptly hanged on June 28th.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>On the day following this execution, a lookout
on Staten Island reported a fleet of forty
sail in sight. The news quickly spread and
the city, not yet recovered from the shock
of the Tory conspiracy, was wild with excitement
once more.</p>

<p>The fleet proved to be from Halifax, and
carried some ten thousand of the troops which
Washington had only recently driven out of
Boston; also there were six transports, having
on board some regiments of Highlanders
which had joined the fleet at sea.</p>

<p>At sight of this formidable armament heading
up the bay, Washington&#8217;s couriers were
sent dashing here and there with the news,
warning all the commanders along the Hudson
to hold themselves in readiness in case the
British should attempt to push their war-ships
up the river. But there was no such attempt.
Day after day, however, the fleet was increased;
not long afterward there were one
hundred and thirty men-of-war and transports
in the bay; the troops were disembarked
and the hillsides of Staten Island were whitened
with their tents.</p>

<p>This force was under the command of Howe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
and Washington watched it anxiously, knowing
that the British general awaited only the
coming of the admiral, his brother, to begin
operations. Young Cooper carried a message
to the President of Congress, urging the Massachusetts
authorities to send its quota of continental
troops to New York; the formation
of a flying camp of ten thousand men in
the Jerseys, to be used wherever required,
was also advised. Recruits began to pour
into the city; upon every open space they
could be seen going through the manual of
arms.</p>

<p>One afternoon, George, who had carried
a dispatch summoning General Greene to
headquarters, was riding with that officer
across a stretch of fields beyond Broadway.
A company of provincial artillery were drilling;
and the deftness of their work, the
smooth, capable manners of their commander,
a small-sized youth of about twenty, attracted
the general&#8217;s attention. Quick to recognize
ability, the general pulled up and sat his
horse, watching the proceedings, and during
a pause he inquired the officer&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>The youth saluted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>&#8220;Alexander Hamilton,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;A
student at King&#8217;s College.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was that same evening, just at twilight,
that George was pacing along Maiden
Lane near to William Street, his hands behind
him and his head bent. He still frequently
rode and walked in that neighborhood; always
did he grow thoughtful when there, and
always upon the same subject. That Herbert
Camp had been recognized by no one but
himself that night at Corbie&#8217;s tavern was evident,
as no search had been made for him;
but George was puzzled to know if he and his
sister had come off unhurt in the rain of pistol
shots that followed the dash from the tavern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither of them could have been grievously
injured,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;If they had
been, they would have more than likely not
have made off so quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was Peggy&#8217;s attitude that occupied
him more than anything else.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_184.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap3"><i>&#8220;ALEXANDER HAMILTON,&#8221;<br />
HE REPLIED</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Now, why,&#8221; the young man mutely demanded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
&#8220;should she so set herself to insult
me? How have I deserved it? Is there one
thing which I have done since I came to New
York and which touched her in any way,
that has not been in the nature of a service?
On the wharf where the &#8216;Nancy Breen&#8217; tied
up, I lent a helping hand to her uncle. And
she recognized it as such, for a few hours
later when those popinjays on the Parade
sought to make me a butt for their wit, she
was kind. I helped her brother out of a tight
place at the &#8216;Wheat Sheaf&#8217;; and even then
she seemed to show appreciation, for she
warned me against a mysterious danger.
Once more at Corbie&#8217;s I try to serve her; and
she turns upon me like a fury.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still fuming along with bent
head when he felt a hand laid upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, young sir, if I am mistaken,&#8221;
spoke a voice; &#8220;but it seems to me
that I should know you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Merchant Camp, and the young New
Englander, freeing himself from his exasperating
thoughts, smiled as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I had the pleasure of meeting you one
morning, sir, on the river front, when a certain
sailorman differed with your political
beliefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stout old Tory burst into a laugh; red-faced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
and gasping a little, he patted George
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Right, lad! So it
was. I knew, the moment I put eyes on you,
that you were one that I should not pass as a
stranger. I suppose,&#8221; inquiringly, &#8220;that I
thanked you at the time? Yes? Well and
good. But I will also thank you now.&#8221; He
shook George warmly by the hand. &#8220;It was
no light thing to do, sir, to lend a hand to a
king&#8217;s man in New York at this time. It
was indeed a matter of some risk. And the
deeper the chance you ran, the greater is my
obligation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The political side of the incident did not
occur to me, Mr. Camp,&#8221; said the youth. &#8220;I
only saw that you&#8217;d be outmatched in a game
of buffets, that was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a sturdy rascal, to be sure,&#8221;
replied the old merchant. &#8220;But take ten
years off my age and I&#8217;d ask no odds of him.&#8221;
He looked at George for a moment, and his
big red face wrinkled with smiles. &#8220;That
was a rare drubbing you gave him,&#8221; chuckled
he. &#8220;But come,&#8221; after a moment. &#8220;I have
yet to hear your name.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;George Prentiss,&#8221; replied the young man.
&#8220;I am from Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prentiss&mdash;Boston!&#8221; The merchant
looked at him with fresh interest. &#8220;Can it
be possible that you are kin to Seth Prentiss
of that city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am his grandson,&#8221; answered George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandson!&#8221; The old man grasped his
hand firmly and his broad face beamed
with good will. &#8220;His grandson, do you
say! Well, well, here&#8217;s a circumstance,
indeed! Why, then, you are own cousin
to my niece Peggy and my nephew Herbert.
Their mother was your mother&#8217;s
younger sister. Surely you&#8217;ve heard her
mention us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frequently, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And still you never made yourself known,&#8221;
inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were reasons, sir. You see, in times
like these&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman did not allow him to
proceed further.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Nothing can
be done straightforwardly these days, with
safety. Perhaps, when all is said, you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
acted well. But,&#8221; in another tone, &#8220;how is
your grandfather?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no one in all the colonies for
whom I have a greater regard than I have
for your grandfather,&#8221; spoke Merchant Camp,
heartily. &#8220;There is no more successful merchant
than he, no more honest man and no
one more devoted to the cause of the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was upon the tip of George&#8217;s tongue to
correct this last, but he restrained himself.
There had been no more ardent king&#8217;s man in
all Boston town than old Seth Prentiss, that
was true. But he had experienced a change
of heart, and now stood as stoutly for the
colonies as he had heretofore stood for their
foes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you,&#8221; went on Merchant
Camp, &#8220;how pleased I am to meet with you,
and all the more so, the conditions being
what they are. I trust,&#8221; eagerly, &#8220;that you
are in no way engaged for the evening, lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent! I am on my way home just
now; I live but a step from here, and I
want&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Here he paused as though something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
had occurred to him; he looked searchingly
at the young man for a moment, then
went on with less enthusiasm: &#8220;If you have
nothing better to do with your time, I should
like to have you dine with me.&#8221; George
bowed his willingness. &#8220;My nephew dines
with me to-night, and he will be pleased,&#8221;
said Mr. Camp. &#8220;And Peggy will no doubt
be delighted to greet her cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then something in the lad&#8217;s expression
seemed to strike him; and after a moment he
added:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, perhaps, on the whole, I had better
not mention your relationship just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; answered George, &#8220;it would be
as well if you did not.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>TELLS HOW GEORGE VISITED THE HOUSE IN<br />
CROWN STREET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> broad-fronted brick mansion in Crown
Street was much like its master. It spoke
eloquently of the days gone by; its furnishing
and appointments clung as tenaciously to
things past as did the political beliefs of their
owner.</p>

<p>A serving man in livery of blue and white
admitted them; and the merchant at once led
George into a room where they found Major
Hyde and the dragoon, Henderson, lounging.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said the old Tory, most
ceremoniously, &#8220;I desire to present you to a
young gentleman who did me a service some
time since. Mr. Prentiss&mdash;Major Hyde&mdash;Captain
Henderson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both officers greeted the young man cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had the good luck to meet with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
when he first came to New York,&#8221; said Hyde.
Then with a laugh, he added: &#8220;Though we
did not consider it good luck at the time,
judging by our greetings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon my word,&#8221; said the dragoon, earnestly,
&#8220;I was never so completely pinked
over anything in my life. Would you believe
it,&#8221; to the merchant, &#8220;I selected him as one
to try my wit upon. And he flayed me, sir.
He flayed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Tory laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe it. He&#8217;s a good up-standing
lad in more ways than one, I
promise you.&#8221; Then after some further conversation,
he said: &#8220;But I&#8217;ll leave him here
with you for a few moments. I have some
small matters to see to.&#8221;</p>

<p>When George met the merchant in the
street, the sky was rapidly becoming overcast,
and the wind raising eddies of dust; and
as they entered the house, large scattering
drops began to fall. Now, as the old gentleman
left the room, the storm broke, and
torrents of driving rain dashed against the
windows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, hello!&#8221; cried Henderson, &#8220;here&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
a state of things, &#8217;pon my soul! There&#8217;s rain
enough for you, major, in all conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ring for lights, there&#8217;s a good fellow,&#8221; said
Major Hyde.</p>

<p>Languidly the fop arose and did as requested;
in a few moments the fine old
apartment was yellowed with candle-light.
Major Hyde sat back in the corner of a sofa
and studied young Prentiss with speculative
eyes. Noting this, Henderson turned to the
young New Englander and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;These days keep some of you fellows on
the jump, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve used up three horses in the last fortnight,&#8221;
said George, &#8220;and I did what I could
to save them, too. And others have been
kept moving more briskly than I, by all
accounts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems the very deuce to get things
settled for a fight,&#8221; complained the fop. &#8220;I
always fancied it was a very simple arrangement&mdash;one
side here and the other side there,
and then go at it like all possessed. But it&#8217;s
really like the plot of a play; everything
must be settled and accounted for before a
blow is struck.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>A rattling volley of thunder rolled along
the sky; then a dash of lightning lit up all
outdoors and showed them Crown Street
running torrents of water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of late,&#8221; said young Prentiss, &#8220;I have
seen but little of either of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been with Greene,&#8221; answered
Major Hyde. &#8220;Indeed, within the week that
we invited you to share our quarters in Wall
Street, we were forced to give it up and transfer
to a barn of a place beyond Brooklyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not fit for beasts to live in, let alone
gentlemen,&#8221; said the dragoon officer. &#8220;I
assure you,&#8221; earnestly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been
asked to put up with such accommodations
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Prentiss had no great tolerance for
complaints of this character; popinjay soldiers
who required to lie soft and live at their ease
were scarcely the sort to win battles. But he
answered smilingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;We had rough quarters enough before
Boston. Sod huts and ramshackle affairs
built of planks were considered luxurious;
and many a winter night some of us slept on
the ground beside a camp-fire.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;At Boston, Mr. Prentiss, you were employed
in a variety of ways, were you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like many others,&#8221; replied the young
New Englander, &#8220;I was willing to give what
service I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, to be sure. But I have heard it
hinted that your service took many uncommon
forms. Your specialty was, in the
main, the flanking of the enemy, not the
facing of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done my share of the secret work
that our necessities required,&#8221; said George,
&#8220;though I never had any partiality or even
liking for that form of the service. But
some one had to do it, and why not I as well
as another?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough.&#8221; Major Hyde settled himself
farther back in the corner of the sofa;
his hands were clasped about one knee; his
eyes were peering and slit-like. &#8220;Of course,&#8221;
he resumed, easily, &#8220;when a person acquires
a reputation for a certain thing&mdash;especially
when he has proven very satisfactory in it,
indeed&mdash;he naturally is given the preference
when work of that sort is needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>George nodded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, quietly, &#8220;I suppose that
is so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Putnam,&#8221; and Major Hyde
laughed, &#8220;is a direct and rather simple-minded
man. He was aware of the quality
of your service, I know; and I suppose he
did not hesitate to use you when occasion
demanded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have undertaken some small enterprises
for General Putnam,&#8221; answered George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you came to New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and before.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence. The foppish
dragoon had sat twiddling his thumbs;
apparently he now fancied that the time had
arrived for him to venture into the conversation
once more; so he leaned toward
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;d not mind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
but here a sharp gesture from his friend
cut him short. George sat facing a window;
and, engaged in watching the play of the
lightning and the dash of the rain upon the
glass, he gave no sign of having noted the
interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a man of parts is employed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
special service,&#8221; said Major Hyde, &#8220;it is
naturally expected that he use his own discretion
in many ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again George nodded. But this time he
said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; proceeded the other, and the slits
between his eyes grew narrower and narrower,
&#8220;there is, I think, a point at which a line
should be drawn. He should not be privileged
to exercise his discretion in all things.
Limitations should be set.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you,&#8221; said the youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the securing of information,&#8221; said
the major, &#8220;he must, of course, be at liberty
to do as he sees fit. But after it is secured&mdash;it
is there that the line should be drawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I quite follow your meaning,&#8221;
said George, vaguely.</p>

<p>At another time his naturally keen perception
would have given him some indication
as to the officer&#8217;s direction; but truth
to tell, George had, for the last few moments,
ceased following the speaker very closely.</p>

<p>The window through which he was gazing
out upon the storm was bowed, and very
large. It was hung with heavy curtains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
that were only partly drawn; and during
the latter portion of Major Hyde&#8217;s remarks,
George detected something like a movement
behind these which had taken his attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some one there,&#8221; flashed through
the young man&#8217;s mind. &#8220;Some one who is
listening.&#8221; However, now that he was sure
of the state of affairs, his self-possession returned;
he gave his attention to the speaker,
all the time watching the curtain with the
tail of his eye.</p>

<p>Major Hyde was frowning a little, but at
the same time he kept a smile playing about
his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make my meaning clear,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Some time ago I had a man servant who
pleased me very much. He had a rare judgment
in the matters that came within his
province, and a close tongue. But&mdash;now,
mark this&mdash;I found after some time that the
close tongue did not always operate in my
favor. He had a habit of receiving messages
and then retailing to me those parts of them
that he considered I should hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not lacking in presumption, along
with his other qualities,&#8221; said George.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;I am inclined to agree with you,&#8221; remarked
Major Hyde, drily. &#8220;He should
have given me a choice at least, as to what
parts I considered of no consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very impudent, &#8217;pon my word,&#8221; observed
Henderson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am of the same opinion,&#8221; spoke George
Prentiss. &#8220;But,&#8221; and he looked at Major
Hyde composedly, &#8220;I am still rather at loss.
Just what is your meaning? Somehow all
this seems to apply to me. If I am wrong in
this I beg of you to say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not wrong,&#8221; said Major Hyde.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; put in the dragoon, &#8220;you are right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Putnam,&#8221; said Major Hyde, &#8220;employed
you upon a certain occasion. I suppose
you recall this, and also the nature of
the employment. Being very intimate with
headquarters affairs at the time, I was well
informed in the matter. But I know that it
resulted in nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that through motives of your own,
you withheld certain information. You knew
that a certain person&mdash;who for the moment
shall be nameless&mdash;was concerned in machinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
against the new government, and yet
you did not denounce him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Footsteps could be heard coming along the
corridor. George regarded the speaker fixedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that I did not?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the barrenness of the result; if you
had done your duty, arrests would have been
made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Camp re&euml;ntered the room; he
carried a paper, apparently a letter, in his
hand; and his face was beaming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;will you do me the
pleasure of walking this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Hyde and Henderson at once arose
and George did likewise. They passed into a
room where a table was laid with much silver
and delicate ware.</p>

<p>&#8220;Being short-handed,&#8221; apologized the old
merchant, &#8220;I must do duty myself.&#8221; Then
to George: &#8220;I sent most of my servants away
yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had again left them, George
turned upon the officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What other reason did you have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other was needed? Could anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
have spoken more eloquently?&#8221; demanded
Major Hyde.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. General Putnam might have
done so.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the young New Englander saw the
two men dart looks of covert meaning at each
other. But he did not wait for either of them
to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another question,&#8221; said he, evenly. &#8220;May
I ask how you came to be so familiar with
what we might call the real results of my
work?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was scarcely perceptible hesitation,
then Major Hyde answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not possible that there are others beside
yourself who have means of gaining secret
information?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us grant that.&#8221; George spoke very
coolly. &#8220;And then let us come to a more
important thing. If you know of this person
whom I have, as you say, failed to report, why
have you waited for me? Why have you not
reported him yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, to the astonishment of George, Major
Hyde burst into a laugh; and his friend
joined him heartily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;Very shrewdly spoken,&#8221; said the major.
&#8220;Eh, Henderson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon my soul,&#8221; said the dragoon, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never listened to a neater stroke of the tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little wager with Henderson, that is
all,&#8221; explained Hyde, putting his hands upon
George&#8217;s shoulders and swaying him backward
and forward. &#8220;I ventured a good dinner
that upon the very next time we met, I
could worm something out of you regarding
your private transactions for the various commanders.
Henderson had a better notion of
your shrewdness than I, so it seems, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I expect the dinner to be paid with
the utmost promptness,&#8221; declared the foppish
dragoon, delightedly. &#8220;But, &#8217;pon my soul,
Hyde,&#8221; with a shout of laughter, &#8220;what a
farrago of nonsense you used to gain your
point! And how you scowled and shook
your head! You should have turned your
mind to play-acting instead of soldiering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I to know, though,&#8221; and Major
Hyde joined in the laugh, &#8220;that I did not
come somewhere near the real facts as they
stand? Come now, was there such a person
as I imagined?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;I can only say,&#8221; returned George, good-humoredly,
&#8220;that I have done my plain duty
upon all occasions. If I say more I may lose
Captain Henderson his dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dragoon slapped his thigh at this, and
vowed that as a witticism he had never heard
its equal.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a rare fellow, this lad from Boston,&#8221;
declared he.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gotten the better of me this time, at
any rate,&#8221; answered the major, good-naturedly
enough.</p>

<p>The two were still laughing and discussing
the matter when the old merchant re&euml;ntered.
Then Major Hyde begged leave to retire for a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have this matter noted down in a little
book which I usually carry,&#8221; said he to
George. &#8220;But it is in the pocket of another
coat which I sent on here with some other
traps a week ago. I&#8217;ll hunt it up and get all
straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a moment do you get out of my sight,&#8221;
declared the dragoon. &#8220;If you go, I&#8217;ll go
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along then,&#8221; laughed the other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll play fair. You shall have a peep with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so out they went; and George heard
them go stamping up the stairs, wrangling
and protesting and laughing; and as he listened,
the young man somehow felt a doubt
creep into his mind.</p>

<small>PEGGY SPEAKS HER MIND</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Was</span> it really as they said?&#8221; George Prentiss
asked himself. &#8220;Was the thing a jest,
after all? Or was it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here his thoughts were interrupted by the
old Tory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted that worthy gentleman.
&#8220;It would seem that my nephew, the major,
is in wonderful spirits to-night. Something
must have pleased him vastly, for I never
saw him so before, that I can recall.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a swish of silken skirts as a door
opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;My niece, Peggy,&#8221; added the merchant.
&#8220;My dear, this is young Mr. Prentiss, who
was of such use to me some few weeks ago
when my villainous temper got me into
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy swept the young New Englander so
elaborate a courtsey that it hinted of mockery.
The smile that wreathed her lips was honeyed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
but the old look of scorn was deep in
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember Mr. Prentiss perfectly,&#8221; she
said, and there was an undercurrent of meaning
in her tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall sit opposite him at supper,&#8221;
promised the stout old fellow. &#8220;And mind
you entertain him well. We owe him something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Prentiss,&#8221; said Peggy, &#8220;should not be
difficult to amuse. He is so interesting himself.
I feel sure that wherever he is, something
will happen; one is not likely to be
dull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! do you hear that, lad?&#8221; Merchant
Camp chuckled delightedly. &#8220;That&#8217;s
saying something of you, surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve it, though,&#8221; answered
George, and his eyes met the girl&#8217;s straightforward
look unsmilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never say that,&#8221; cried the honest old
uncle. &#8220;Leave others to speak ill of you,
my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently,&#8221; said George, his eyes still
meeting those of Peggy, &#8220;they are only too
ready to do that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the old gentleman, &#8220;you are
over young to have observed such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes it is made so plain,&#8221; replied
George, &#8220;that it requires no great experience
to know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The merchant laughed good-humoredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a philosopher of gloom in you, I
see.&#8221; Then turning to his niece: &#8220;What do
you say to this, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please, sir&mdash;nothing,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>She walked to one of the windows, her
silken skirts swishing; and the old merchant,
puzzled, turned to George and shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an odd one at times,&#8221; he said, lowly.
&#8220;Very much like her mother was&mdash;and there
was no keeping the run of her for five minutes
together.&#8221;</p>

<p>George made no reply to this; he stood
with his back to the fireless hearth and
watched the tall young figure at the window
with its proudly-posed head. After a moment,
the merchant, as though something
had just occurred to him, took a letter from
his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to speak of this when I first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
came down,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But those gentlemen
of Mr. Washington&#8217;s were in ear-shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>He unfolded the sheet while George looked
at him surprisedly. The expression &#8220;gentlemen
of Mr. Washington&#8217;s&#8221; seemed odd.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will amuse you,&#8221; continued the stout
old Tory in a low tone, &#8220;but when I was
about to ask you here to-night a thought
struck me, and I hesitated. Not that the
outcome would have made any real difference,
you see, for I should have asked you anyhow.
But I hastened to refer to this,&#8221; holding out
the letter, &#8220;as soon as I got here. And the
result has pleased me. I am delighted that
you are one of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like my grandfather&#8217;s writing,&#8221;
George said, lowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; replied Merchant Camp. &#8220;It is a
letter of his written me when Warren and
Hancock and the Adamses first began to take
such a high hand in Boston. In it he speaks
of how families were divided upon the question
before the public eye. His own, like
mine, was in this deplorable condition.&#8221;
Here he held the letter to the light so that
he could read it. &#8220;Listen to this: &#8216;One of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
my grandsons, Ezra, is in favor of the Whiggish
demands; the other, George, is a king&#8217;s
man through and through.&#8217;&#8221; Merchant Camp
looked up from the screen and smiled at the
young man. &#8220;That is what I wanted to
make sure of. I knew that one or the other
of you was on the right side; and I am delighted
that it&#8217;s you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he grasped the hand of George with
great warmth. The youth, disliking that
any one should have a false impression of
him, was about to put the matter before the
merchant in its proper light, but at that
moment Major Hyde and his friend, Henderson,
re&euml;ntered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find that the terms of the wager
were&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Here Hyde observed Peggy and
paused. Holding a small note-book toward
George, its pages open that he might read, he
continued in a lower voice, &#8220;The terms, as
you see, are merely that I manage to get you
talking on the subject mentioned.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man noted that this was so;
but there was something in the proceeding
and in the eager intentness of the two men
that caught his attention.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;But,&#8221; continued Hyde, &#8220;Henderson interprets
it that I extract information from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said the dragoon, and in the
same low tone as his friend, &#8220;I dare say we
can arrange the matter. We must not delay
the supper,&#8221; in a louder voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good, sensible saying,&#8221; spoke the host.
&#8220;And as sense is not to be expected of
scatterbrains who take sword against rightful
authority, all the more credit is due you,
Master Henderson.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dragoon laughed, as did Hyde.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear that, Prentiss?&#8221; cried he, as
they all seated themselves at the table. &#8220;Do
you notice how you are referred to? A
&#8216;scatterbrain,&#8217; says he.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Tory favored George with an
elaborate wink, which not only expressed
delight, but spoke of what he considered the
secret understanding between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say,&#8221; remarked he, &#8220;that we of
the king&#8217;s side have as bad said of us&mdash;or
worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the meal progressed, the wind and rain
did not abate; the thunder rattled and rolled;
the lightning glared against the sky. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
merchant had placed Peggy just opposite
George, and the lad made the best of the
opportunity. But the girl was silent. The
best he could draw from her was a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or
a &#8220;No&#8221;; and all the time her face was cold;
her eyes, when he caught them, were judging
him cruelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has become of Herbert?&#8221; asked
Captain Henderson, after a time. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
seen him for weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old merchant scowled down at his
plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is difficult to keep track of that young
man,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great pity that he left the army,&#8221; observed
the dragoon. &#8220;Especially at this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It altogether depends upon the point of
view,&#8221; replied the Tory host. &#8220;But, that
aside, hide nor hair of him I have not seen
for some time. I don&#8217;t,&#8221; with displeasure,
&#8220;even attempt to understand him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To understand people is one of the most
difficult tasks a person can set himself,&#8221; said
George. As he spoke, his eyes met those of
Peggy. &#8220;But for all that,&#8221; he went on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
&#8220;there are those whose judgments of others
are made offhand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt, no doubt,&#8221; answered Mr. Camp.</p>

<p>But it was not until after supper that
George had his first opportunity to speak to
her alone. The old merchant had mentioned
an ingenious method that he had hit upon
for packing breakable articles, and had carried
the two officers into another room to demonstrate
it to them. The spring storm was still
raging; the flare of the lightning every now
and then dimmed the drawing-room candles;
the wind continued to beat up from the bay
with fury.</p>

<p>The girl was in a deep window-seat, looking
out upon the storm; the night was inky, but
the flare of the lightning was so incessant as
to afford an almost continuous view. George
leaned back against a carved table, and as he
trifled with the stems of some roses which he had
found thereon, he watched her reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; said he, at last, &#8220;that
perhaps I may have been wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not even turn her head, but went
on gazing steadily into the rain-drenched
Crown Street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; proceeded George, &#8220;the judgments
which one is led to believe are quickly
made are really arrived at after some
thought. It is even possible that your
estimate of me came after due deliberation.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this she turned, as he felt sure she
would. The lightning glared in at the
window behind her; but the flash of her
eyes was the quickest to reach him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is strange,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you go on
holding this attitude when you must know
that I am not to be deceived. I did not require
to deliberate; your acts were all that
were necessary to make up my mind concerning
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gleam of satisfaction came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; He threw the roses back upon the
table and studied her closely. &#8220;That is it,
then?&mdash;my acts? Thank you. At last we
have come to something specific.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will point out anything that I have
done since I came to New York, which I cannot
successfully defend,&#8221; continued he, &#8220;I
shall be willing to have you think what you
choose of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she gave a gesture of utter disbelief.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;I am not interested,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It does
not matter to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it does to me. You seem to forget
that.&#8221; His voice was hot with anger. &#8220;Do
you expect me to hold my tongue, accused as
I am of some rascally act! Not once, not
twice, but a half dozen times you have hinted
at something discreditable that I have done.
Speak plainly. Give it a name, so that I may
meet it squarely!&#8221;</p>

<p>His resentment was low-voiced and sharp;
his face was flushed and determined; his
hands were clinched until the knuckles
seemed ready to split the skin that covered
them. As she looked at him a hesitancy
seemed to temper her scornful attitude; for
the first time since she had assumed it, a
doubt crept in and mingled with her disdain.
But for all that she retained her former tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what use would it be to give it a
name?&#8221; she said. &#8220;You know it already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon me if I insist,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;I differ with you in opinion&mdash;I
oppose the faction that you hold to, and upon
this you have reared a fanciful structure of
evil. I demand that you be plain.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;You demand!&#8221; Her voice rang as she
said this and her eyes flashed her defiance.
But almost instantly her manner changed.
&#8220;A fanciful structure, indeed! Do I not
know&mdash;haven&#8217;t I seen? Haven&#8217;t I heard?
And my treatment of you is not because you
oppose the faction that I hold to. There are
others in this house,&#8221; bitterly, &#8220;who do the
like, yet I believe them honest men. It is,&#8221; and
her voice fell a trifle, but lost none of its
directness, &#8220;because you hold faith with no
faction&mdash;because you are a traitor to all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flush died out of his face; he took a
step toward her, astonishment replacing the
rage of a moment before. But before he could
speak another word, the two officers and the
host re&euml;ntered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I defy any one,&#8221; declared the old gentleman,
&#8220;to destroy valuables so arranged.
They&#8217;ll go safely enough, though the roads
across Jersey are somewhat rough,&#8221; with a
laugh. &#8220;Indeed, I wish we were assured of
as comfortable a journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you start?&#8221; asked Major Hyde.</p>

<p>&#8220;At high noon to-morrow. We have a
coach with good springs and can secure relays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
of horses. Two days should see us at home,
if nothing unforeseen turns up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; spoke the dragoon, &#8220;that you
do well to leave New York so soon. There is
no telling, now, when all the roads will be
closed and Lord Howe&#8217;s guns roaring havoc
across the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would not drive me out,&#8221; stated the
Tory merchant, &#8220;if it were not for Peggy.
Indeed, gentlemen, it would please me greatly
to stay and see the end of this uprising.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think, then, that it will end here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never was more convinced of anything
in my life. The governmental officers are determined
to efface the stain put upon them at
Boston, and that they will do it is a certainty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the talk drifted away into the field of
politics; the merchant did most of it, and he
did it heatedly and most eloquently. The
time went by and the storm seemed to increase.
By ten o&#8217;clock Peggy begged leave
to retire, as she had some tasks to perform
against the journey on the morrow. George
lingered on and on in the hope that she
would return to the drawing-room; but she
did not.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>It was close to midnight when he at last
arose to take his leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Mr. Camp. &#8220;In such a
drenching downfall as this? Never, sir.
You&#8217;ll be wet through. I have a room for
each of you, and you shall all three remain
and take breakfast with me&mdash;my last in New
York under rebel rule, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Prentiss did not protest against this
with any great vehemence; the wind and
rain, and the thunder and lightning, though,
had little to do with his agreeing to remain
the merchant&#8217;s guest. It was very late when
he, at the heels of Hyde and Henderson, and
each bearing a lighted candle, mounted the
wide staircase to their chambers. The flickering
yellow light fell before and about them,
but there were dark corners which remained
heavy with shadow; and from one of these a
pair of terror-filled eyes followed them; two
trembling hands were upraised to hide a
frightened girlish face.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>SHOWS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE TAPESTRIED
CHAMBER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> room that fell to the lot of George
Prentiss was a huge one, square, high ceilinged
and hung with rich but faded tapestries.
The furniture was dark and massive;
a great four poster bed of mahogany, with a
spreading canopy over it, stood near the door.</p>

<p>There was a wide fireplace, the clean-swept
hearth of which showed no indication of a
fire having been lighted in it for some time.</p>

<p>When George had bidden the others good-night
he closed the door and placed his candle
upon the table. The light danced grotesquely
upon the walls, dimly illuminating
the quaint figures upon the tapestry and the
old paintings that hung here and there. The
young man drew the curtains at the windows
so that the flare of the lightning would not
disturb him; there were other candles upon
the mantel and having a curiosity to better
view his apartment, he kindled a pair of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
and placed them where they would do the
most good.</p>

<p>The tapestry proved to be an ancient French
one, and depicted the deeds of Charles Martel;
the portraits were partly of New Amsterdam
Dutchmen and with a good sprinkling
of English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ancestors,&#8221; mused George as he gazed at
these. &#8220;I can see the features of my host in
most of them.&#8221; His eyes paused upon a large
painting at the far end of the apartment; it
was so somber, the shadows played so upon it,
that he took up a candle and went nearer.
Holding the light so that he could view the
picture to better advantage, he saw the name
&#8220;Dirk Van Camp&#8221; upon the heavy frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;A burgomaster of the old Dutch days,&#8221;
said George to himself. &#8220;And a stern, dogged
sort of a fellow he must have been, judging
by his face.&#8221;</p>

<p>The furnishings of the tapestried room were
mostly of European make; Dutch tables and
chairs; English sofas and stands; and near
to the fireplace stood a tall French mirror
that swung in its frame. George sat down in
a heavy chair before this and began removing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
his cravat; his back was turned to that end
of the apartment where hung the portrait of
Burgomaster Van Camp, and the light of the
candle which George had left upon a stand
near the picture threw the determined, joyless
face into good relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good shelter and a four poster bed are not
to be treated lightly on a night like this,&#8221; the
young New Englander told himself, as he
threw the cravat upon a table. Then he removed
his short sword and the pistol which
he had kept buttoned under his coat while in
the drawing-room; after this he began tugging
at one of his riding boots.</p>

<p>It was while he was so engaged, for the
boot was stubborn, that he caught the reflection
of the burgomaster&#8217;s portrait in the
mirror. The chair in which George sat hid
the greater part of the picture; but the face
was plain, and it was as though it was peering
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there is a grim old curmudgeon for
you,&#8221; smiled the youth. &#8220;I&#8217;ll venture to say
he never laughed in his life save when he had
driven a hard bargain, or gotten the better of
some one in another fashion.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>He threw the boot down on the hearth and
before he drew off the other, sat gazing into
the mirror at the portrait. Suddenly the
smile left his face and he started a little.
The eyes of old Dirk Van Camp were small
and black and deeply-set under heavy brows;
George had noticed them especially a few
minutes before, while examining the picture;
and now as he looked into the glass, he saw
them glint in a marvelously lifelike manner.</p>

<p>For an instant it was in his mind to turn
and stare at the portrait; but like a flash he
regained control of himself, and sat motionless,
gazing into the mirror. Some few minutes
passed in this way; but he could now
detect nothing out of the ordinary. True, the
eyes had an unusually lifelike appearance;
but that may have been due to the skill of the
artist, or, perhaps, it was the unsteady light
of the candles. He lay back in the chair in
the lounging posture of one entirely at ease;
but never for an instant did his apparently
careless glance leave the pictured eyes. At
length he muttered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the lights; their flickering gave the
appearance of movement; and the varnish
upon the canvas is the cause of the really lifelike
sparkle.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_220.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>THE HAND PAUSED</i></p>

<p>He was about to give the matter up and
proceed with his preparations for retiring
when a thought struck him. With the utmost
naturalness he stretched out his hand
toward the table, and while so doing, his eyes
remained fixed upon the pictured ones in the
mirror. With a thrill he saw these latter
follow the hand; beyond the shadow of a
doubt they turned slowly and keenly; and
when the hand paused and clutched the
pistol butt, there was a change in their expression&mdash;and
their steadiness wavered.</p>

<p>Calmly George drew the pistol toward him
and made a pretense of examining the lock;
all the time his heart was bumping in a
tumult; strange thoughts filled his brain.</p>

<p>&#8220;The eyes of the portrait are removable,&#8221;
he told himself. &#8220;There is a door or a panel
behind it, and some one is stationed there
watching me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat for a short space nonplussed; and
all the time he saw the eyes fixed upon him.
The situation was an odd one; he did not
know how to meet it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Tory house,&#8221; were George&#8217;s thoughts,
&#8220;and there may be those hidden within its
walls of whom I know nothing.&#8221; An idea
flashed upon him that made him start. &#8220;And
yet I might know considerable of them,&#8221; he
added; &#8220;and I might be suspected of knowing
even more than I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>This latter idea rapidly took definite form
in his mind. As likely as not Herbert Camp
was hidden in the house&mdash;perhaps without his
uncle&#8217;s knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;But his sister is aware of it,&#8221; was the
young man&#8217;s further thought, &#8220;and who
knows,&#8221; bitterly, &#8220;but that she still fancies
me in pursuit of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this his mind was made up; he put the
pistol down upon the table, and then pulled
off the other boot. After this he stood up,
and divested himself of coat and waistcoat;
he put out two of the candles, permitting that
near the picture of the burgomaster to remain
burning. Drawing a tall leather screen
up to the four poster he spread it out and then
with a wide yawn went behind it as though
to complete his disrobing.</p>

<p>Now, as before said, the bed stood near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
door, and when George spread the screen, he
hid the door from the view of the peering eyes
behind the portrait. So instead of going on
with his preparations for bed, the young man
softly opened the door, and all unarmed as he
was, stepped out into the hall.</p>

<p>This latter was dark and still, and step by
step he made his way along, being careful
not to knock against anything that might be
in his way. He had not gone many feet
when he saw that the door of the apartment
next his own stood partly open; it was only
a trifle and but a trickle of light showed itself.
He approached the door softly. It was in
this apartment that the spy would be hidden,
for the portrait was backed against the wall
that divided it from his own. He had all
but gained the door when there came a sharp
exclamation and the stir of feet upon the
other side of it; for a moment he feared that
he had been discovered and halting, braced
himself for whatever was to come. But there
was nothing save a continued and low-pitched
sound of voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more than one,&#8221; he murmured
softly. This knowledge, however, did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
stay him; once more he made for the door
along the edges of which the light was seeping.
The opening was too small to admit of
his gaining a view of even a part of the room;
but he could hear the almost whispered words
distinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very annoying to be spied upon,&#8221;
said a voice which George at once knew as
Major Hyde&#8217;s. &#8220;And I am surprised that
you should stoop to it. Or, perhaps,&#8221; and
there was something like a sneer in the tone,
&#8220;you will deny that you were spying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; came the voice of Peggy Camp, &#8220;I
do not deny it. I saw you steal along the
hall and followed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite sure,&#8221; and there was a keen
note of inquiry in the man&#8217;s voice, &#8220;that you
were not already in the room when I entered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not in the habit of misrepresenting
my actions,&#8221; returned Peggy, and the listener
fancied her head rearing proudly as she said it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. But at a moment like this!
Who knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you do,&#8221; returned the girl.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence; then Major
Hyde spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;What made you think that my actions
had anything to do with him?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew from the first that you were laying
a trap for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; There was a note of surprise in
his voice. &#8220;You are even keener than I
thought you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew that he would be here,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;And you proposed carrying it through
here, of all places.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not given to us to choose our opportunities,&#8221;
said the major. &#8220;So I&#8217;ll strike
when I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course your feelings in the matter are
perfectly natural,&#8221; spoke the man coolly. &#8220;I
understand them very well. They are to be
expected of you. But is he worthy of all
you&#8217;d do for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not. He is a worming, designing
villain; there is no truth nor honor in him.
To serve his own ends, he&#8217;d sell his friends to
their enemies&mdash;he&#8217;d sell his cause to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know, I know,&#8221; cried Peggy, and
there was pain in her voice. &#8220;I know it all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
better than you can tell it. I know it and
hate him for it; and yet I cannot see him
harmed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Herbert is concealed in the house, as I
suspected,&#8221; thought the young man at the
door. &#8220;Major Hyde has in some way learned
of it, and being aware of his treachery, is trying
to locate his hiding-place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voices within the room now sank even
lower than before; George listened intently,
but could not make out what was being said.
Some minutes passed in this way and the
voice of Peggy was raised in gladness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You promise me that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Herbert is safe,&#8221; she whispered
thankfully. &#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; as though
preventing his interrupting her; &#8220;he does not
deserve it, but I am happier than I can tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is safe from me,&#8221; spoke Major Hyde,
slowly, &#8220;but I am not the only one. Don&#8217;t
forget that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He said no more, but George Prentiss was
as sure that his hand lifted and his finger
pointed to the tapestried chamber as he would
have been had he seen him do it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>There was a gasping cry, smothered and
full of fear. Then the girl replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that, too. It is horrible. But,&#8221;
and her voice suddenly became clear and
sure, &#8220;he shall not harm my brother. That
he is here seeking information, I know. But
he shall learn nothing&mdash;he shall do nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who will prevent him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; she answered and her voice was
filled with resolve.</p>

<p>Again their voices sank; then George heard
footsteps advancing toward the door. A tall
Dutch clock stood near by, as the inquiring
hands of the young New Englander had
learned, and quickly he shrank close to its
side as the room door swung open.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bid you good-night, cousin,&#8221; said the
voice of Major Hyde, &#8220;and advise you to go
to your chamber.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Peggy&#8217;s answer was George did not
hear. Then the major shut the door and
passed down the corridor; the soft closing
of another door told the watcher that he
entered his own room at the far end.</p>

<p>George waited for some little time, fearing
that Peggy would emerge and discover him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
But as she did not do so, he quietly tiptoed
to his own room. Drawing aside the screen
he stepped out into the center of the apartment,
yawning and putting back the hair from
his eyes, as though he&#8217;d been asleep.</p>

<p>At once his gaze went with studied carelessness
to the portrait; there were the eyes, eager,
alert, inquiring, fixed upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said he, with ready art, as he
yawned again. &#8220;I must have fallen into a
doze.&#8221;</p>

<p>Negligently he threw himself once more
into the chair before the mirror and sat looking
at the reflected eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is she,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;There is no
one else there. And it&#8217;s been she all along.
Hyde was right. She was already in the
room when he entered, as he suspected.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then suddenly he became aware that the
eye sockets of Burgomaster Van Camp were
empty. Vacantly the portrait stared down
from the wall. But only for a moment.
Suddenly a long, black cylinder was thrust
through one of the apertures&mdash;there was a
puff of smoke, a loud report, and a pistol
bullet whizzed past his head.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>IN WHICH IS FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF LONG
ISLAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> smoke of the pistol was drifting toward
the ceiling as George wheeled toward the
portrait. But the blank spaces were now
filled by the painted eyes; there was no trace
of anything being amiss. For a space after
the crash of the shot died away there was
complete silence. Then a hum grew through
the mansion; doors began to open and shut,
voices were lifted in anxious and frightened
inquiry.</p>

<p>But George Prentiss paid little heed. He
stood in the center of the room gazing into
the heavy face of the old burgomaster, incredulity,
fear, astonishment mingled into
one expression. Peggy had tried to take his
life, was the horrid thought that filled his
mind; to save her brother she had attempted
to shoot his fancied pursuer in the back.</p>

<p>Up and down outside his door hurried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
unshod feet; the voice of the stout old merchant
could be heard demanding, threatening,
raging. But what his words were, George
did not gather; indeed, his brain seemed
numbed by what had happened; he felt as
though it were moving in a sort of haze and
could grasp no fact save the one.</p>

<p>Then a knock sounded upon his door; dully
he turned and opened it; Mr. Camp stood there,
and at his back were a couple of frightened
servants bearing lighted candles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Prentiss,&#8221; said the merchant, &#8220;we
were startled a few moments ago by what
sounded much like a musket or pistol shot,
in or near this room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon me, but I am going over
the house to make sure that all is well.&#8221;</p>

<p>George smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been no harm done me, as you
can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am delighted to hear it. But it&#8217;s most
strange. It sounded much as though it were
within the house, and yet it scarcely could
be. Pardon me again for disturbing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>All night long George sat in the empty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
chair by the hearth; the rain ceased, the
clouds drifted away and both moon and stars
looked serenely down upon the drenched
earth. And when morning came he descended
to find the servants already loading
the household valuables into covered wagons.
He ate breakfast with his host.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always kept this place intact against
my infrequent visits,&#8221; said he to George.
&#8220;But nothing will be safe, now that a war is
upon us, and I&#8217;m taking away all I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have Major Hyde and Captain Henderson
not yet arisen?&#8221; asked the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;An hour ago,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;They
could not await you, and begged me to mention
their regrets. And my niece is discommoded
with a headache, a thing uncommon
with her. So I will be forced to say good-bye
for her,&#8221; added the honest old gentleman a
few moments later when George arose to take
his leave. &#8220;But believe me, we were all
pleased to see you and will be again when it
is possible. Should you ever cross the Jerseys,
lad, don&#8217;t fail to hunt us out. The Elms, we
call the place, and it&#8217;s less than a dozen miles
out of the town of Trenton.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;I shall be glad to do so, sir,&#8221; said the
youth.</p>

<p>The old gentleman lowered his voice so
that none of the bustling servants might
hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that you are now engaged
with the undertakings of this man Washington.
And to one of your opinions this can
only mean one thing. You are spying on
them.&#8221; The distaste in the merchant&#8217;s voice
was plain, and he added: &#8220;If you will be
advised by me, you will give it up. It is not
to my liking, and should not be to yours.
Take service with Lord Howe. Fight the
rebels for all that&#8217;s in you&mdash;but fight them
fairly.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so George left the mansion in Crown
Street to take up his duties; and the next
time he rode that way the place was closed
and deserted. What his thoughts were, he
kept to himself; but that they were unpleasant
was clearly evident. But it was no time for
wandering thoughts. There was scarcely a
day that history of a more or less important
degree was not in the making.</p>

<p>While New York was slowly being encompassed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
by foes, great things were being done
some little distance south. At Philadelphia,
Congress was discussing a question which
John Adams referred to as &#8220;great as ever
was or will be debated among men.&#8221; On the
second of July a resolution passed the body
declaring the colonies free and independent;
on the fourth, the Declaration of Independence,
as drafted by Mr. Jefferson, was adopted.</p>

<p>Riders were sent scurrying in all directions
with fair copies of this; and on the evening
of July 9th, Washington caused it to be read
at the head of each brigade of the army.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; he said in his orders, &#8220;that this
important event will serve as a fresh incentive
to every officer and soldier to act with
fidelity and courage, as knowing that now
the peace and safety of his country depend,
under God, solely on the success of our arms;
and that he is now in the service of a state,
possessed of sufficient power to reward his
merit and advance him to the highest honors
of a free country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bells were rung, guns sounded, bonfires
gleamed at every street corner. An excited
throng gathered in the yard of the &#8220;King&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
Arms&#8221; and planned an escapade which they
felt would fittingly crown the moment.</p>

<p>A man well known as an enthusiastic
member of the Sons of Liberty sprang up and
addressed those present.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;a word with you.&#8221;
By the expression of his face they knew he
had something of interest to propose; and so
all conversation was hushed. &#8220;We are done
with kingly government and with kings,&#8221;
proceeded the speaker. &#8220;And this being the
case, we have left something undone. On
Bowling Green, near the fort, is a statue of
King George&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>An instant roar went up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall it remain longer than it takes us to
make our way there?&#8221; demanded the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the throng, as one man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us start at once. But remember
one thing. This statue is made of lead.
And lead is the metal that bullets are made
of. What more fitting than that the presentiment
of a king be run into bullets to be used
against his hirelings!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delighted with this, they streamed into
Broadway and toward the fort; amid the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
shouts of hundreds who gathered to see the
sport, the statue was pulled down and broken
up. And legend has it that it was indeed
run into bullets for use against Lord Howe
and his army.</p>

<p>A few days after this the city was struck
with panic. Two ships of war got under way
and headed up toward the battery. One was
found to be the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix,&#8221; forty guns; the
other was the &#8220;Rose,&#8221; a vessel of twenty, and
commanded by Captain Wallace. Alarms
were sounded; the Americans flocked to their
posts. With wind and tide behind them the
British ships swept up the bay with three
tenders following, all shaping their course for
the Hudson. The batteries from both the
city and Paulus Hook opened upon them.
The war-ships answered with broadsides, but
kept on their way. The fleet made no attempt
to ascend, holding to their anchors; and seeing
this and drawing from it that there were
no prospects of an immediate general attack,
the townspeople breathed freely.</p>

<p>The troops at the Highlands were made
ready; river sloops and all boats of any size
for miles along the Hudson were requisitioned;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
the forts and batteries were manned;
as far as might be, all was prepared for anything
that might come.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day that the &#8220;Rose&#8221;
and the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; made their dash there
was a great booming of cannon from the
enemy&#8217;s shipping off Staten Island. A ship
of the line had just come in from sea; at
her foretop streamed the British ensign, and
her sister ships thundered a smoking welcome.
And an increased feeling of dread ran through
the city when it was learned that Admiral
Lord Howe had arrived.</p>

<p>The crisis was now at hand, and all disaffected
persons were removed from the city.
General Lord Howe immediately opened
negotiations. While military diplomats
wrangled over forms, the militia along the
Hudson kept up a constant bickering with
the two ships that had forced their way up
the river and were now within six miles of
Fort Montgomery. Brushwood was piled at
intervals, so that beacons could be lighted to
give warning in time of danger; fire ships
were made ready to float down against the
war vessels, and General Putnam was proceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
with a plan for the obstruction of
the channel, his notion being to prevent the
passage of hostile vessels up or down the
river.</p>

<p>Watchful eyes then made out another incoming
fleet. It was of a hundred sail, and
carried huge reinforcements to the British
land force; one thousand of the already
detested Hessians were among them. These
disembarked on Staten Island and threw up
earthworks. Scotch, English and German
mercenary troops continued to arrive; then
came the army under Sir Henry Clinton,
which had only lately been rather soundly
beaten at Charleston.</p>

<p>The British land force now numbered some
thirty thousand experienced men; that under
Washington was less than twenty thousand.
And these latter were raw, undisciplined
troops for the most part; they were badly
armed, and most of all they were torn with
sectional animosities. Bilious and other
fevers were rampant among them; one-quarter
of their number were on the hospital
list; and the remainder were compelled to
cover a defense fifteen miles in length.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>The watchful Washington missed few of
his opponent&#8217;s movements. Through spies
and deserters he learned that many of the
British regiments had re&euml;mbarked, three
days&#8217; provisions had been cooked, and every
indication pointed to some large movement
being at hand. Then General Putnam
brought word that one-quarter of the ships
had sailed, probably around Long Island.</p>

<p>The American general stood ready with
his force to meet the movement of Howe as
soon as it should develop sufficiently to be
intelligible. The movement, so he reasoned,
would be to land a force to attempt Brooklyn
Heights, which commanded the city of New
York.</p>

<p>General Greene and his army held Brooklyn,
a strong line of works stretched across the
peninsula, upon which the town stood, running
from Wallabout Bay on the north to
Gowanus Cove on the south. A battery was
mounted on Red Hook to protect the rear
from the shipping of the British; a fort occupied
the lower point of Governor&#8217;s Island.</p>

<p>A range of hills stretched away before
Greene&#8217;s intrenchments; it was densely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
wooded and cut by three passes. One of
these led to Bedford in the east, the second
opened to the southeast toward Flatbush,
while a road ran through the third that led
directly south by Gowanus Cove and Gravesend
Bay. It was undoubtedly General
Greene&#8217;s purpose to man the hills and defend
these passes; but as fate would have it,
he was taken down with a violent fever, and
General Sullivan was placed in temporary
command.</p>

<p>From the American camp of Livingston
on the Jersey side, much British preparation
was discerned. Word was sent to New York
that thirty thousand troops had been crowded
into the transports riding at anchor off Staten
Island; these were to attack Long Island, and
the remaining regiments were to be launched
against other points at the same time.</p>

<p>The day after this news was received, the
dull roar of cannon was heard from the south
of Brooklyn; Washington instantly sent a
reinforcement of six battalions across the
river; more would have gone, but it was
not yet known where the attack would really
center.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>With these battalions went George Prentiss,
his friends Brewster and Cooper and his
brother Ezra. Next day the latter, who had
been riding for Sullivan to the south of the
town, made known to his friends what had
occurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Hand was stationed with his
Pennsylvania riflemen to guard the landing-places;
a force of artillery and light horse
crossed and drove him back. Sir Henry
Clinton commanded this landing in person;
but under cover of a smart rifle fire, Hand
took possession of the hills commanding the
Flatbush pass. Some light infantry, and
Donop&#8217;s Hessians, came on to seize this; but
seeing that the riflemen were capable of
making a stubborn and bloody resistance,
they halted and rested for the night at Flatbush.</p>

<p>&#8220;The remainder of Clinton&#8217;s force is laid
out from the Narrows, where they landed, to
Flatbush, which is almost a straight line to
the east.&#8221;</p>

<p>On August 24th, Washington crossed the
river and carefully inspected the scene of the
coming struggle; Greene&#8217;s plans were at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
hand, but the gallant Rhode Islander was too
desperately ill to explain them. As yet, nothing
but skirmishing was indulged in, and it
was fortunate for the Americans that this was
so. If the British had plunged forward, the
rout of the patriot army would have been complete;
for, because of the absence of Greene
from the lines, things were in a bad way.</p>

<p>&#8220;The conditions are even worse here than
they were before Boston at the beginning of
the siege,&#8221; Ezra Prentiss said to his friends,
as they stood awaiting orders in front of Sullivan&#8217;s
headquarters. &#8220;Confusion and disorder
are everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Each man is his own law,&#8221; agreed young
Cooper. &#8220;They don&#8217;t wait for instructions if
they feel inclined to take action against the
enemy; and if they are not so inclined, they
refuse to move, no matter what the orders
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when Putnam took command, this condition
was to a large extent altered, for that
doughty warrior called the officers together
and in plain terms told them what was expected
of them; stern measures after this effected
something of a change.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>British preparations continued. At length,
two more brigades of Hessians under De Heister
crossed the Narrows; and when Washington
noted this he was convinced that now indeed
the blow was to be struck; accordingly
what troops he could spare were sent to join
Putnam&#8217;s force on the east side of the river.</p>

<p>On the evening of August 26th, Clinton
began a movement with a body of picked
troops toward Flatbush Flatlands; after him,
trailing through the darkness, came Percy
with the artillery, grenadiers and dragoons;
and close to Percy&#8217;s heels marched Cornwallis
with the heavy ordnance. Like ghosts the
silent columns changed their course at Flatlands
and flitted across the New Lots. A
Tory who knew every inch of the ground was
at their head, and he brought them safely
through the marsh to the Jamaica Road. To
Clinton&#8217;s astonishment, the Bedford pass was
undefended, and through it he went, followed
by Percy and Cornwallis; at daylight
they breakfasted within three miles of Bedford;
and the Americans never dreamed of
their being anywhere at hand.</p>

<p>Three hours after Clinton began his movement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
the British general, Grant, according to
plan, started with the left wing of the enemy&#8217;s
force from Gravesend Bay. Some New
York and Pennsylvania militia retired before
him, keeping up a brisk rifle fire. A party
of scouts brought the news of this advance to
Putnam; and at once General Sterling was
rushed forward to hold Grant in check.</p>

<p>The scouts rode ahead, testing every doubtful
point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daylight will soon be upon us,&#8221; said
George Prentiss, &#8220;and that will give us some
idea of what force we will have to contend
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These fellows behind us are the pick of
Putnam&#8217;s force,&#8221; said Ezra. &#8220;Indeed, they
are the only well-trained regiments I&#8217;ve seen
here, and should be able to give a good account
of themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Sterling reached the Gowanus pass
he found his scouts mingling with the militia
in the graying dawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;The report is, sir,&#8221; said George, saluting
the general, &#8220;that the enemy is close at
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the indifferent light, Lord Sterling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
selected the points of vantage. To the commander
of the militia he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Draw your men up in that orchard on
the left of the road; we may manage to have
them walk into an ambush.&#8221;</p>

<p>While this was being done, Sterling formed
his own men along a ridge that ran from the
road to a hilltop. Under a steady fire the
British came along; but they avoided the
ambush by throwing forward some light
troops; and at broad day these, from behind
hedges and trees, were facing the Americans
at a distance of some hundred and fifty yards.</p>

<p>But the blow was to be dealt on the Flatbush
Road. While darkness hung over all,
the Hessian, De Heister, opened with his guns
on Hand&#8217;s riflemen, who defended the pass
under the direction of General Sullivan.
Some ships of the line attempted to get into
action; but heavy head winds drove them
back. The &#8220;Roebuck,&#8221; a rather small vessel,
managed to beat up against the wind, however,
and she opened upon the fort at Red
Hook.</p>

<p>During all this, Washington was in Manhattan;
the people of the city were wild with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
terror, for it was still believed that the real
attack would be leveled at them. But in a
little time the commander-in-chief saw that
this was not to be the case, so he had his
barge manned and crossed to Brooklyn. And
he arrived in time to see the first blows struck.</p>

<p>Clinton, having comfortably breakfasted,
now brought forward his artillery; the guns
thundered the awaited signal. At once De
Heister knew that the American left had been
turned; and he hurled his Hessians under
Count Donop upon the Flatbush pass. Sullivan
also caught the sound of Clinton&#8217;s guns;
they were in his rear, and the truth struck
home instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fall back!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>As the German troops pressed forward, no
one remained to resist them; down the opposite
side of the hill rushed the Americans,
hoping to escape being surrounded. But
when they reached the plain, Sullivan saw
that he was too late. Clinton&#8217;s light infantry
and dragoons were upon them like cats.
Back the patriots rushed into the pass, only
to be greeted with a stream of lead from the
mercenaries&#8217; muskets.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;We have them!&#8221; shouted Count Donop
in his hoarse German. &#8220;At them, my
children!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Americans recoiled from the sleet of
bullets, but only to fall upon the sabers of the
British dragoons. Backward and forward like
shuttlecocks they were driven; first the British
would send them reeling toward the Hessians,
then the latter would, in turn, hurl them back
upon the British. But not for a moment did
the patriots cease fighting; their rifles belched
in the faces of the foe, their bayonets ran red
with blood. The pass roared with conflict;
mercy was not asked nor given; above the
barking of muskets, horses neighed and
trumpets shrilled their high-voiced commands.</p>

<p>At length Sullivan was taken prisoner, and
with him a large body of his men; another
section of the command broke through the
mass of the British and gained their own
lines, but by far the greater number of the
brave fellows lay dead among the stones of
the pass.</p>

<p>Before this dreadful blow was dealt the
colonial hopes, Lord Sterling was exchanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
shots with the British under Grant at the
Gowanus pass. When the heavy guns of
Clinton announced his presence at Bedford,
Grant began a determined advance; with one
rush he crushed and took the raw militia.</p>

<p>It was here that George Prentiss&#8217; knowledge
of the country, gained in his long rides and
his sketching, was brought into play. Sterling,
with his officers grouped about him, was
endeavoring to hit upon a way out of a
desperate situation. For desperate it was.
Cornwallis, while Sterling was facing Grant,
had rapidly brought the British reserve from
Bedford by a narrow road; and he was now
directly in Sterling&#8217;s rear. As Sullivan had
been between the fires of Clinton and De
Heister, so Sterling was between those of
Cornwallis and Grant.</p>

<p>As George pressed toward the group about
Sterling, an officer whispered something in
the general&#8217;s ear. Instantly the latter&#8217;s glance
went to the young New Englander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prentiss,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;m told that you&#8217;re
familiar with this section.&#8221;</p>

<p>George lifted his hand in a salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, general.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;Our only hope seems to be to the west and
north of us. What is the ground like in that
direction?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a creek, sir, which flows into
Gowanus Cove; it is fordable at low water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the state of the tide now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It happens that I do. It&#8217;s coming in at
this hour, but should still be low enough to
pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once Sterling&#8217;s orders were given; part
of his force was left to face Grant; the remainder
marched at a double quick for the
creek. They had sighted it when a cry from
Ezra drew the attention of his superiors. His
finger was pointing to a growth of bush between
them and the coveted stream. Above
this could be seen the head-pieces of the
British grenadiers and the cold gleam of
their bayonets.</p>

<p>Only one commander in a thousand would
have thought of resistance now. But Sterling
was that one man. Calmly he gave his orders.
With a part of one battalion of Maryland
men, he boldly threw himself upon the grenadiers;
and while he so engaged them the rest
of the command crossed the creek.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>With these latter were George Prentiss and
the party of scouts; it would have pleased
them more to have stayed; but their orders
were imperative; a swamp stretched from the
creek almost to the American lines, and some
one must guide the Delaware men, or they
would be caught like rats.</p>

<p>No more desperate fighters than the five
companies which Sterling retained were in
the American army; they flew at the stalwart
grenadiers like game-cocks; repeatedly they
were broken, but each time they rallied and
renewed the fight. Once, indeed, they crushed
the solid formation of Cornwallis, and started
the grenadiers on the run; but as fate would
have it, bodies of British reinforcements came
up, and the brave fellows were forced to retreat.
Even then, Sterling, with a part of
what was left, held his ground long enough
to permit another detachment of his force to
cross the creek to safety.</p>

<p>Broken and desperate, they made their last
stand in a clump of trees. Washington, who
was watching the fight through his glass from
a high hill within the American lines, grew
sick at heart as he witnessed the gallantry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
this little band and saw the fate that must
overtake them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas!&#8221; he exclaimed to some of his staff
who stood near. &#8220;What brave fellows I must
lose this day.&#8221;</p>

<p>And lose them he did. They were borne
down and bayoneted in a corn-field, or shot
as they endeavored to escape across a marsh.
To the very last, Lord Sterling encouraged
them by presence and word and deed; and
when all was lost he gave up his sword to the
Hessian general De Heister.</p>

<p>Then came the moments that meant much
to the colonies; mad with victory, the British
massed before the American redoubts; within
musket shot they poised for the charge that
would end the fight. Washington prepared
for a desperate defense of Brooklyn; his
cannon played upon the massed columns
fiercely, and seeing that he was resolved to
hold his position at all hazards, Clinton gave
orders that his eager troops be held in check.
To storm the American works would have
been the quicker and more spectacular way;
but hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives must
pay for it; and this crafty tactician was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
given to wasting his force. So he drew off
his men and they encamped out of musket
shot for the night.</p>

<p>But it was no night of rest for George
Prentiss and his fellow riders. Through the
darkness they tore, never heeding life nor
limb; the length and breadth of Manhattan
was crossed, and the dispatches they bore set
troops in motion all over the island.</p>

<p>Day broke dismal and lowering after a fearful
night behind the colonial works. Twenty
thousand of the enemy were encamped in
plain sight. Then through a drenching rain,
the American reinforcements arrived. Among
these were Glover&#8217;s hardy New England seamen,
Shee&#8217;s crack Philadelphia regiment, and
Magan&#8217;s Pennsylvanians; also Mifflin&#8217;s troops
from Kingsbridge and Fort Washington.</p>

<p>The downpour seemed to dampen the spirits
of the British; they ceased their artillery fire
and took to their tents; only some desultory
rifle shooting between the advanced posts was
indulged in. Late in the afternoon, when
the rain slackened, they began to intrench,
their idea being to advance by regular approaches,
each protected by an earthwork.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>Next day there was a heavy fog. George
Prentiss, scouting in the neighborhood of Red
Hook, saw an unusual activity among the
British shipping off Staten Island, during a
moment when a trifling breeze had lifted the
mist from the waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there!&#8221; he cried to his friends.
They had but a glimpse of the war-ships
before the fog settled once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be something going on,&#8221;
said Ezra.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I caught a glimpse of small boats
plying between the ships and this side,&#8221; added
Brewster.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt you did,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Twice
the other day the British caught us between
two fires. And not satisfied with that,&#8221; confidentially,
&#8220;they are going to try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Do you mean that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That they are coming up with the next
wind and tide. This battery,&#8221; pointing to
the Red Hook defense, &#8220;can&#8217;t hope to keep
them back, and the Governor&#8217;s Island and
city batteries are not much better. Let them
once anchor in the East River and Washington&#8217;s
army is lost. His retreat will be cut off.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>They put their tired horses at a gallop back
to the lines. To some staff officers they imparted
their news, and the commander-in-chief
at once called a council of war. Other
hostile craft were known to have rounded
Long Island and gained Flushing Bay; should
these land troops east of the Harlem they
might take Kingsbridge, which all knew to
be the key to Manhattan.</p>

<p>A retreat was decided upon that very
night!</p>

<p>Again the fleet horsemen were in the saddle.
This time they bore orders for the requisition
of all craft between Spuyten Duyvil
on the Hudson and Hell Gate on the Sound;
and by evening a huge fleet of all sizes and
trims were gathered at the Brooklyn side of
the river.</p>

<p>The enemy was so close that the sound of
their sentries&#8217; voices could be heard, and to
move an army of nine thousand men from
under their very noses was an appalling military
task. And yet it was done. Company
by company, regiment by regiment they embarked
and under cover of the fog which still
prevailed, they slipped across to New York.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
Horses, wagons, ammunition, provisions and
artillery were also transported. By daybreak
General Mifflin&#8217;s covering party also entered
the boats; and in the last of these could be
seen the tall figure of Washington, gazing
back through the gray light of the morning
toward the heights.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is what he feared from the first,&#8221;
whispered George Prentiss to his brother.
&#8220;They will mount the guns there that will
drive him from Manhattan.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>DESCRIBES HOW GEORGE AND HIS FRIEND START<br />
UPON A DANGEROUS MISSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next two weeks were filled with memorable
events; they saw the execution of the
daring young schoolmaster, Nathan Hale; they
witnessed the thronging of the British war-ships
into the Hudson, and the landing of
Clinton&#8217;s heavy force on Manhattan Island at
Kip&#8217;s Bay; and, also, they saw the massing
of Washington&#8217;s battered army upon Harlem
Heights.</p>

<p>Then began a series of desperate ventures
with fire ships, sallying parties and raids in
which the brutal Hessians had a chance to
show their quality; Fort Washington was
taken by Howe; and then began the terrible
retreat across the Jerseys. Cornwallis, relentless
as a bloodhound, hung upon the trail of
the American army. At Newark, his advance
guard entered the town as the American rear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
was leaving it; at Trenton the British reached
the banks of the Delaware only to see the
camp-fires of the patriots burning on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>New Jersey now fell into a state of terror;
the Hessians overran everything. Following
the example of their leaders, they plundered
left and right. None escaped them; Tories
suffered as well as patriots; houses &#8220;protected&#8221;
by the sign manual of Cornwallis
himself were sacked; women and children
were turned out into the winter cold with
scarce enough to cover them. In a spirit of
retaliation, the American troops on the west
of the Delaware also entered into the game of
pillage; for miles and miles they looted the
homes of all suspected of being in sympathy
with the British. This grew in extent until
Washington posted most severe penalties for
all engaged in plunder.</p>

<p>The knowledge of what was going on in
New Jersey excited the most bitter hatred
against the Hessians. But through it all,
Washington, and those nearest him, remained
calm; they watched and waited, and all the
time they strove to get their forces into shape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
to strike a blow that would be at once quick
and deadly.</p>

<p>The deeds of the Hessians brought horror
to all who heard of them, but to none did the
measure seem so full as to George Prentiss.
When some fresh enormity reached his ears,
there always flashed upon him a picture of a
stately manor house in the possession of these
lawless ruffians; he saw, also, a white-faced
girl and a helpless old man, and none to lift
a hand in their defense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should you ever cross the Jerseys, lad,&#8221;
old Camp had said, &#8220;don&#8217;t fail to hunt us
out. The Elms, we call the place, and it&#8217;s
less than a dozen miles out of the town of
Trenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dozen miles! It must, then, be in the
very heart of the section where all was pillaging
and burning and hanging.</p>

<p>George had kept his brother Ezra acquainted
with all the happenings that bore
upon the Camps; and in many things Ezra
had advised wisely. But just now he was detailed
upon service at Philadelphia under
Putnam, and his absence was badly felt.</p>

<p>Nat Brewster and Ben Cooper began to notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
the eagerness with which George sought
news from across the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is something more than common,&#8221; said
young Cooper. &#8220;Every chance he gets, he&#8217;s
riding along the shore; at night nothing
seems so attractive to him as the firelights on
the Jersey side. He watches them by the
hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says nothing, though,&#8221; replied Nat
Brewster, &#8220;and I have the impression that
whatever it is that&#8217;s on his mind it&#8217;s something
he wants to keep to himself. So I&#8217;ve
never asked him any questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>One afternoon, only a few days after the
above words were spoken, Brewster, grave-faced
and quiet, opened the door of the hut
which the three had erected for shelter.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s work to do,&#8221; he stated, as he sat
down before the fire.</p>

<p>George, watching his friend&#8217;s face closely,
saw that something important was under
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Volunteers are demanded to cross the
river and learn the enemy&#8217;s strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are one,&#8221; and George sprang up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
knocking over the stool upon which he had
been sitting and causing the crazy little hut
to vibrate with his eagerness.</p>

<p>Nat nodded. George dashed open the door
and was away. The winter blast swept in
and the blaze roared up the rude chimney.
Ben closed the door, his lips puckered in a
whistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now,&#8221; said he. &#8220;What did I tell
you? Something&#8217;s over there,&#8221; and he jerked
his head in the direction of the river, &#8220;that&#8217;s
on his mind. The only wonder to me is that
he hasn&#8217;t crossed before now, orders or no
orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>In about half an hour George reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I go with you,&#8221; he said, his eyes alight
and with more spring in his step than they
had seen for some time. Their arms hung
upon the wall, and instantly he took down
his pistol and began putting it in order.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need to hurry matters,&#8221; answered
Nat, quietly. &#8220;Great speed at a time
like this is as like to bring disaster as anything
else. Take time; more than bustle
will be required to land us within the British
lines&mdash;in safety.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>George had great respect for Brewster&#8217;s
shrewdness and resourcefulness; so holding
his eagerness in check, he sat down and began
recharging the pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been thinking the matter over,&#8221;
said he to Nat.</p>

<p>The latter nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no password,&#8221; said he slowly;
&#8220;and even if we had I doubt if it would be
of much service with the Hessians. They
seen to disregard everything but their own
desires. Like as not we&#8217;d each have a musket
ball or bayonet planted in our bodies if we
encountered them in any other way than one
which pleased them.&#8221;</p>

<p>George looked up from the pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know of anything that would be
pleasant to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; said Nat. &#8220;You see, the
countryside all about Trenton is being drawn
upon for provisions for the troops.&#8221;</p>

<p>A set look came into young Prentiss&#8217;
mouth; his eyes grew hard in the firelight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can cross the river to-night and
make our way some distance into the interior,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
perhaps we can meet with the teams that
bring in the forage. Every American to be
found is impressed to help in this work. All
we need do is to show ourselves; and as the
bringers of food, we&#8217;ll pass muster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a good plan enough,&#8221; said George.
&#8220;I accept it as it stands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would accept any plan that promised
to land you across the Delaware,&#8221; was Ben
Cooper&#8217;s thought as he listened and watched.
&#8220;And you&#8217;d not question any of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it happened that as the early
December evening fell, two loutish looking
fellows made their way toward the Delaware
at a point some distance beyond the American
lines. The wind that swept up from the deep
dark river was icy and damp; for all their
greatcoats and muffling neckerchiefs they
shivered and swung their arms for warmth.</p>

<p>Once upon the bank they paused. Frozen
fast in a little runlet they found an old ferry-boat
that George had noticed before.</p>

<p>It required more than an hour&#8217;s hard work
to free it from the ice; then with the heavy
sweep they smashed the formation that extended
out from the bank, and were afloat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
The point was some miles above Trenton,
and the ice-floes were thick and running
freely with the tide. For over an hour
they strained and tugged, and at length the
heavy bow of the ferry crushed through the
thin ice on the Jersey side, and they scrambled
ashore.</p>

<p>The tide had carried them well down
toward the Hessian outposts; and turning
their backs upon these they trudged their
way along a snowy road that ran northeast.
As the night went on it grew colder and
colder; more snow began to fall; they could
feel its wet softness upon their faces.</p>

<p>Far off in the distance, a bell struck the
hour mournfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Midnight,&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;And getting colder every moment,&#8221; answered
George.</p>

<p>The white of the snow pressed in upon
them from the further darkness, and the way
grew more and more difficult. Suddenly
Brewster felt his friend clutch his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nat,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Look there.&#8221;</p>

<p>A faint point of light appeared off to the
right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s moving,&#8221; spoke Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than likely a lanthorn,&#8221; said young
Prentiss.</p>

<p>They paused and watched the glimmer of
light; little by little it drew nearer. The
bearer of the lanthorn apparently had great
trouble in making his way along, for his pace
was very slow.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s plowing through the drifts,&#8221; said
George. &#8220;There must be open fields in the
direction from which he&#8217;s coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at last the stranger struck the road,
and his pace increased; in a very little time
they could hear his feet crunching the snow,
then they caught the growling undertone of
angry words.</p>

<p>&#8220;So there are two of them,&#8221; whispered Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he&#8217;s talking to himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearer came the light bearer; and they
could now distinguish what he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I should live to see the day,&#8221; he
mumbled. &#8220;That I should live to see an
English king send such a horde of rascally
dogs down upon his people. Dogs, did I
say? They&#8217;d shame the name of dogs; a
decent cur would not own them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>Grumbling and stamping in the snow he
passed them unnoticed, a stout figure in a
heavy cloak and with a broad woolen scarf
bound over his hat, adown his ears and
knotted under his chin. A little distance
away they saw the light halt, then came the
rattling of a lock and chain and the door
of a low barn-like structure creaked open.
The man set his lamp down within, stamped
the snow from his feet and then closed the
door. At once George began making his
way toward the building; but Nat took him
by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to make sure of something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carefully they crept toward the building;
but before they reached it there came a low
knocking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; came the voice of the
man who had borne the lanthorn. &#8220;Who
comes knocking at this hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door. It is I!&#8221;</p>

<p>At once the door reopened; a second
and slighter form flitted in, and again it
closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay here,&#8221; whispered George to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
friend. &#8220;I shall be gone only a short time.
Keep a lookout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied Brewster.</p>

<p>George stole away toward the building; it
proved to be a log structure, chinked with
clay; its one window had been broken,
apparently, for some boards were roughly
nailed across the opening, and the seams
between stuffed with rags. It required but
a moment for him to work an opening in
one of the seams large enough to enable him
to obtain a view of the interior.</p>

<p>There was a low, rudely raftered ceiling
through which protruded wisps of rye straw;
the room was filled with smoke; there was
no chimney to carry it off. The first thing
that George heard was a prolonged fit of
coughing; he could dimly make out two
forms through the blue haze, but not enough
to be sure. However, in a manner, his suspicions
proved to be correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think,&#8221; said the voice of the man with
the lanthorn, &#8220;that I should ever be brought
to this. Strangled in a hovel not fit for beasts.
But I&#8217;ll be even with them, or my name is
not Camp.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>&#8220;It was he, then,&#8221; breathed the watcher
softly.</p>

<p>There came the flapping of a broad hat
within and the smoke began to thin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the only building left on the
place?&#8221; asked a second voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only one. Every other is burned to
the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rascals!&#8221; said the second voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rascals! They are the most murderous
villains unhanged! They stop at nothing.
I held the &#8216;protection&#8217; of Lord Cornwallis
before their eyes&mdash;there was his
signature and seal as plain as day&mdash;but I
might as well have shown it to a drove of
mad bulls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no way of punishing them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None. Their own commanders alone have
authority over them; and they are as bad as
the rank and file.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fortunate,&#8221; exclaimed Merchant Camp,
amidst another fit of coughing, &#8220;that you got
your sister Peggy away, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Herbert again!&#8221; breathed the one outside,
for the first time realizing to whom the second
voice belonged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t have done to have left her
hereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You placed her with the Hawksworths?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And she is perfectly safe there, for
Hawksworth has some British army friends
quartered with them&mdash;a colonel and a lieutenant-general.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Mr. Camp, as though greatly
relieved. &#8220;She&#8217;s safe enough, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been best if you both had
remained in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancied that I left there to escape persecution,&#8221;
said the old Tory, bitterly. &#8220;But
I must say that the rebels were as mild as
children when compared with these who
should be my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They tried to be just, at all events,&#8221; said
Herbert Camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I see that now, though I didn&#8217;t
then. But I see many things now, as a matter
of fact, that I didn&#8217;t see then. I once thought
Mr. Washington a great villain; but now I
consider him a brave and honest and able
gentleman&mdash;one who has clung to his beliefs
in the face of defeat; and one who will continue
to so cling until the last.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;I have often heard you express admiration
for tenacity of purpose and for the man who had
the courage of his convictions,&#8221; said Herbert.
&#8220;And yet you were willing enough to have
me change my coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; and there was a curious little
break in the old man&#8217;s voice, &#8220;the day that
you threw down the sword you had taken up
for the colonies was one of the bitterest in my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>There came an exclamation from Herbert;
but he spoke no words.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I threatened to strike you from my
will,&#8221; continued the old Tory, &#8220;I did it
through motives of pride. I wanted to show
my friends how strong the family character
was; I desired to convince them as to its
ruggedness and firmness and truth. I said to
you in the presence of all: &#8216;Give up your
principles or give up my money.&#8217; I expected
to see you throw the insult back into my
teeth&mdash;uncle and all as I was. But you
shamed me, you caused my pride to fall in
ruins about me. You took me at my word.
You traded your honor for money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle!&#8221; George heard a scraping of feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
which told him that Herbert Camp had
sprung up; and there was a ring in his voice
that thrilled. &#8220;Do you mean to say that
you&#8217;d have been better pleased had I held to
the American cause?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. Strange as it may seem, I do say it.
You would have shown that you were honest
and steadfast, even though I thought you
wrong. As it is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not complete the sentence and for a
space nothing more was said. Then Herbert
spoke once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said he, &#8220;suppose that I should
tell you that I had not been false to my
principles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean this?&#8221; And the old man&#8217;s
voice rang sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So then,&#8221; and there was bitter anger in
the tones, &#8220;you pretended. You tried to
humbug me. You were willing to stoop to a
mean deception in order that you might
retain my good will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; sternly, &#8220;is perhaps worse than
the other thing of which I thought you guilty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
Out of your own mouth you have proved
yourself a designing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But here the young man stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said he; &#8220;uncle, wait! Before
you say anything more, listen to me for a
moment. It is true that I have deceived
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not for the mean reason that you
suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other reason could you have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a moment and I will try to
make all plain to you. It had come to my
ears that a plot was on foot&mdash;the same that
eventually resulted in the hanging of Hickey,
one of General Washington&#8217;s guard. When
you made your proposal it instantly occurred
to me that if I seemed to fall in with your
views, I might be able to learn what was
going forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A renegade, you know, is always the
most eager to proceed against his former
friends; and I hoped that this fact would
gain me credit among my country&#8217;s foes.
Believe me, uncle, it hurt me to deceive you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
I longed to tell you plainly that I was only
acting a part. But I dared not.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, there was Peggy!&#8221; There was
a moan in the young man&#8217;s voice; and George
Prentiss recalling his sullen face and heavy,
brooding brows, was surprised. &#8220;You know,
uncle, what we always thought of each other.
You know that we were inseparable from
childhood. And you also know what an
ardent friend to colonial liberty she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here George just smothered an astonished
outcry. Peggy Camp a patriot! A patriot!
And he had thought her a Tory! Why, if
that were the case&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>But he had no time for thought. Herbert
was still speaking, and he could not lose a
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when she heard of my supposed
change of front, she did not say a word, but
the way she looked at me, I shall never forget.
Contempt was the weakest thing in it&mdash;scorn
was there, and pity also. For a moment
I felt that I could not stand it. I felt
that I must tell her the truth. But I did not.
An unguarded word from her to my enemies, a
look, even, might ruin my chances for success.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>&#8220;Success?&#8221; There was a note of interrogation
in Merchant Camp&#8217;s voice. &#8220;And
were you successful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The regret in the young man&#8217;s voice
was undoubted. &#8220;Misfortune dogged me constantly.
At first I was reported as a traitor
to General Putnam and was quietly arrested.
But I convinced him of my innocence, explained
to him my plan and was liberated
that I might carry it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was this plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was to gain the good will of Governor
Tryon in the first place; but this I could
never do&mdash;the way to him was blocked by the
very persons whom I suspected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who were they?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment George felt a hand laid
upon his arm; he turned, the heavy pistol
leaping from his belt; but Nat Brewster&#8217;s
voice whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one&#8217;s coming this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cautiously they drew back from the hut;
and when they had reached a safe distance,
they paused, knee-deep in the snow, and
listened.</p>

<p>Whips were snapping, horses were floundering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
through the drifts, men&#8217;s voices were
crying out sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;A provision train,&#8221; said Nat. &#8220;A provision
train, bound for Trenton, as sure as
you live!&#8221;</p>

<small>TELLS OF TWO PATRIOTS IN TRENTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span> was right. A half dozen clumsy-looking
sleighs, drawn by farm horses, came
lumbering slowly along the road; in the light
of the lanthorns that swung upon the side of
each, the two young men saw that the vehicles
were piled high with sacks of flour, barrels of
salted meat, bacon, hams, and slaughtered
hogs and sheep.</p>

<p>The drivers clump-clumped along doggedly
by the side of their horses; at the front and
rear of the train rode a party of horsemen.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the opportunity you spoke of, just
as though it had been made to your order,&#8221;
whispered George. &#8220;But how are we going
to take advantage of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us follow on behind. They may stop
somewhere, and we can happen along&mdash;two
honest and rather thick-witted fellows that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
we are&mdash;and who knows but that something
might turn up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Allowing the sleighs and the horsemen to
proceed a certain distance, they fell in behind
and trudged in their tracks. George&#8217;s mind
was full of what he had just heard; but try
as he might, he could not reconcile them with
the facts as he knew them.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing alone convicts him and shows
me conclusively that his tale was merely an
invention,&#8221; reasoned the young New Englander.
&#8220;And that is the letter of the British
governor Tryon to the Tory mayor of New
York. In that, Tryon recommended this very
young man to the mayor as one to be trusted&mdash;one
who had served him before and would
again. And yet he has just told his uncle
that he attributes the non-success of his &#8216;plan&#8217;
to the fact that he could never gain Tryon&#8217;s
confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he was aware that Nat had halted,
and so drew up beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have stopped,&#8221; said Brewster.
&#8220;Now is our chance. Remember, now, you
are a thick-headed lout, willing to work and
willing to take kicks and cuffs for your pay.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>Adopting a gait in character, they shambled
on and into the light of the sleigh lanterns.
The train had arrived before a roadside inn
of a low type. The drivers were struggling
to draw their sleighs up to the side of this,
but the drifts were deep and the horses sullenly
refused to exert themselves.</p>

<p>The officer in command of the guard flew
into a rage and brandishing his riding whip,
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pigs! Have you no brains! You must
first a way make. Come, now! Shall I stand
for you here in the cold!&#8221;</p>

<p>The drivers, who were apparently farmers
of consequence, impressed by the Hessians,
muttered among themselves rebelliously.
And it was here that the two rough figures
came up from the rear, seized shovels from
the sleighs and fell to on the drifts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach! das is gut!&#8221; approved the German
officer. &#8220;Here men are who can work.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a very short time the sleighs were
through the drifts, and the soldiers were
thronging the inn. In about an hour they
were ready to start once more upon the cold
road to Trenton. But as they filed out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
mounted, the two supposed country bumpkins
bent low over the blaze upon the hearth and
seemed content to remain where they were.
The leader of the Hessians espied them, however,
and his heavy lash snapped about their
ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with you,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Shall we
Hesse men into the cold go, and you two pigs
stay by the fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested Nat, in a dull sort of way,
&#8220;we are going to stop here for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Donner und blitz!&#8221; exclaimed the officer,
&#8220;shall I tell you again! Out with you! And
be quick! Such as you may needed be before
we are far gone on our journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>So out the two darted, dodging the lash,
and took up places beside the sleighs, still
making a pretense of protesting; and then
away they went toward Trenton. The snow
fell thickly and steadily; the road grew more
and more difficult; at length, at daybreak,
they sighted the town; and an hour later they
were unloading the stores.</p>

<p>This once finished, the two young men had
little difficulty in slipping away; and then
began their work of observing the enemy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
position, numbers and general frame of mind.
Some days passed&mdash;days of hardship and hard
usage. With their rough dress, their unkempt
heads of hair and grimy faces and hands, they
were the butts of the brutal mercenaries that
filled the town. They were forced to do all
sorts of menial and laborious work; but as
this permitted them to gain entrance at points
where information was to be had, they fell in
with the demands of the Hessians readily
enough.</p>

<p>To the British and the Hessians, the American army
was a dispirited and broken crew
of ragamuffins. They knew how to run and
dodge, that was all. At Trenton, all across
the Jerseys and at New York, careless confidence
was supreme. Howe was quartered at
Manhattan for the winter; his troops were
negligently stretched from Brunswick to the
Delaware. Three regiments of Hessians under
Colonel Rahl occupied Trenton and the
towns near by; and the general conduct of
these filled the two spies with satisfaction.</p>

<p>That iron discipline that has ever marked
the German army, and which had been the
particular characteristic of the Hessians since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
landing in America, had now relaxed. They
held Washington in contempt. When one of
the veteran officers suggested the erection of
earthworks, Colonel Rahl laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Earthworks for those rats across the river!
Ach! you are joking!&#8221; was what he said.
&#8220;In a little time there will be ice where there
now is water; then we will cross over and at
them with the bayonet.&#8221;</p>

<p>This attitude of their commander had been
taken up by the men; they gave little thought to
the enemy; being comfortable and having more
than enough food was of vastly greater interest.</p>

<p>Cornwallis had secured leave and was at
New York about to take ship for England;
Grant, who was in charge of the noble earl&#8217;s
division, thought almost as meanly of the colonists
as did Rahl.</p>

<p>All these things became known to the two
eager-eyed young men, and more. They had
been in the town perhaps a week, when one
afternoon Brewster said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing more of value to be
learned. Suppose we try to get across the
river to-night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>They stood at a point just above Trenton
where they had the stream in view, but were
well out of sight of the guards.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no boats to be had,&#8221; said young
Prentiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tested the ice last night, almost opposite
this point,&#8221; said Nat. &#8220;It was strong enough
to bear a man&#8217;s weight then; and it&#8217;s been
freezing hard ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it would not bear two even now,&#8221;
suggested George.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought of that. We had better go
one at a time. Then should an accident happen
to one, the other would still have a
chance to get the information to camp in
safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment George was silent; then
with a hand upon his friend&#8217;s shoulder, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind venturing first? I have
excellent reasons for asking this of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As well first as last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you get across without harm, as I hope
you will, I mean to remain here for a little
longer,&#8221; spoke George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remain!&#8221; there was astonishment in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
other&#8217;s voice. &#8220;But why? We have learned
all we can hope to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter is a private one,&#8221; returned
George. &#8220;Some time I will explain all, but
not now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat said no more. That night they again
sought the same spot; the sky was high and
starry, but there was no moon; the river
looked like a great snow covered field of ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just light enough for me to see and not
enough for them to see me,&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you are going to have much
trouble in making the passage,&#8221; said his
friend. &#8220;The ice looks firm enough to support
a troop of dragoons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s for it; and I trust that you
are right.&#8221; They clasped hands tightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget the signal that&#8217;s to tell me
that you are safely across&mdash;a fire upon the
hilltop just above there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll light it as soon as I arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll watch here for it until midnight.
If I don&#8217;t see it by that time, I&#8217;ll be sure that
something has happened to you and will make
the attempt myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said Nat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dark form flitted down to the river&#8217;s edge
and stepped fearlessly upon the ice; then it
headed for the Pennsylvania shore and was
soon lost to view. The night was cold and
still; George could hear the crunching of his
friend&#8217;s shoes in the frozen snow for some
time after he had lost sight of him. But after
a little, even that ceased; he heard a clock
strike nine and then ten from a tower in the
town; then followed what seemed ages of
waiting. The watcher trembled with the
cold; his feet were numbed; his hands were
useless. Just as eleven boomed out, mournfully
and far off, there was a faint flare from
a knoll across the river; then it mounted to
a ruddy blaze and George gave a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s safe,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Safe! And now I
can turn my hand to my own work.&#8221;</p>

<small>HOW COLONEL RAHL PROPOSED GIVING A<br />
CHRISTMAS CONCERT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">George</span> learned that the Hawksworths,
with whom Peggy was staying, were an
English family who owned vast acreages in
the Jerseys; the head of the house was the
younger son of a duke, his wife the daughter
of a viscount; and their connections were
extremely fashionable. They resided in a
fine brick mansion in the best section; and
because of their high estate and the fact that
they quartered a lieutenant-general, they had
a brace of pigtailed Hessians constantly on
guard at their front door.</p>

<p>Once or twice, George&#8217;s affairs had taken
him by the house, and he found it quite as
compelling as the one in Crown Street, New
York. But he never saw Peggy. As a matter
of fact, he made no especial effort to see
her; he felt that he was upon urgent business
for headquarters, and that it was his place not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
to attract any more attention than was necessary.</p>

<p>But now that Nat had safely carried their
harvest of news across the river, the boy
considered himself more of a free agent than
before; and his own affairs came uppermost
in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy Camp has held me up to contempt,
insulted me to my face and even tried to take
my life,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;And yet I want
to see her. I want to see her just once. I
want to tell her how I regard her, and then I
want to see no more of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>But for a person dressed as he was to gain
admittance to one under the care of the
aristocratic Hawksworths was clearly impossible;
and so he sought a tailor, a hair-dresser
and a haberdasher; emerging from
their hands, he was spick and span and
eligible for any company. And, also, which
came as an afterthought, he was open to detection.
No doubt there were numerous New
York king&#8217;s men in Trenton upon various
errands connected with the service; and some
of these who had seen him there would know
him for what he was.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll take the chance,&#8221; he muttered;
&#8220;nothing is gained except by venturing. A
bold manner will win me a way, perhaps,
even if any one should recall me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he sought out an inn which was patronized
by persons of quality, and calmly installed
himself therein; there were many
officers of Rahl&#8217;s brigade quartered there,
but that made little difference; the nearer
to the danger mark at times, the safer one
may feel.</p>

<p>The inn was directly across the way from
Rahl&#8217;s headquarters; from his windows the
young New Englander could see the sentries
pacing up and down; the half circle of
cannon grinned grimly down each street that
led thereto.</p>

<p>George had not been a guest at the inn
more than a day or two when he noticed
that the sound of music was almost constant
at headquarters. The landlord, a Tory, made
a wry face when George mentioned the
matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rahl is a madman for melody,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;No matter what else is toward, his concerts
must not be interfered with; he&#8217;ll sit for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
hours before the fire, beating time with his
fingers. The best fed men in his army are
the musicians. As for me, I wish they&#8217;d
choke themselves with their own bugles and
fifes; one can&#8217;t get a wink of sleep at times
for their blowing and braying.&#8221;</p>

<p>It wanted only a little time now until
Christmas. This has always been a festival
greatly in favor with the Germans. The
plundered countryside suffered more than
ever; the mercenaries made a clean sweep
of what was left; nothing escaped them;
sleigh train after sleigh train entered Trenton
from all directions; herd after herd of sheep,
swine and beef were driven over the snowy
roads.</p>

<p>And the more deeply engaged the Hessians
became in these preparations for the festival,
the less attention they gave to duty. Neglect
of even the simplest military precautions became
common; one unacquainted with the
real conditions would have said, upon observing
their indifference, that there was not an
enemy within five hundred miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were not for the river,&#8221; said George
to himself time and again, &#8220;Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
would need only make a swift dash and the
town would be his.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that even the ice-choked river had
no terrors for the American commander was
soon made plain to the boy. He had just
finished his noonday meal and arisen to his
feet when he heard a guarded voice say in
his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess you ain&#8217;t no friend to Mistah
Brewstah?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a black boy, woolly-headed and with
solemn eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied George, in the same low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you &#8217;blige me wif you name, suh?&#8221;
The black boy was caution itself. George
told him his name, and the solemn eyes
gleamed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Das it, sho&#8217; &#8217;nuff,&#8221; he said. Then lower
still, &#8220;I got a lil&#8217; bit o&#8217; writin&#8217; fo&#8217; yo&#8217;, suh.&#8221;</p>

<p>A strip of paper was slipped into the young
man&#8217;s hand. It read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Crossing Christmas night. Fire on hill
back of where I left. Put out at once&mdash;don&#8217;t
cross. Allow to burn&mdash;all is well.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thrill ran through George&#8217;s body. At a
glance its meaning was plain to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;The army crosses the river on Christmas
night,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I am to light a signal
fire on the hill back of the spot where Nat
left me last. If I put the blaze out at once it
will mean that I find it dangerous for them
to make the attempt. If I keep it burning,
it will mean that the time is ripe for the blow
to be struck&mdash;that the Hessians suspect nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment he continued gazing at the
paper, fascinated; then he turned to the messenger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who gave you this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistah Brewstah, suh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was jes below de town, suh, a few hours
ago. Reckon he&#8217;s gone now, &#8217;cross de river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what&#8217;s written on this
paper?&#8221; keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed no, suh. I can&#8217;t read writin&#8217; no-how.
It&#8217;s sumfin &#8217;bout Gen&#8217;ul Washington,
though. Mistah Brewstah done told me that
when he said I was to be ca&#8217;ful and not let
the British see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he come to give it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wu&#8217;ks for Mistah Spen&#8217;sah, outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
town; Mistah Spen&#8217;sah is a friend to Gen&#8217;ul
Washington&#8217;s gen&#8217;l&#8217;men, an&#8217; he done tol&#8217;
Mistah Brewstah that he could done trust me.
I&#8217;se pow&#8217;ful sot &#8217;gainst dese heah Hushians, I
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some time after the lad had gone
George stood immovable reading the paper so
that there could be no mistake as to its
meaning. Then he touched one end of it to
the flames upon the broad hearth and watched
it blacken and curl. A door opened and the
draught carried the charred fragments up the
wide chimney; George was still bending
toward the fire meditatively, when a harsh,
high-pitched voice demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are my friends, sir? Come now,
don&#8217;t keep me kicking my heels and waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something familiar in the tones,
and George lifted his head and gazed at the
speaker. The man was burly, red-faced and
had small, deeply-set eyes; and his manner,
as he stood waiting for the landlord to reply,
was oddly like that of an ill-trained mastiff.
It flashed into the youth&#8217;s mind that he had
seen this man somewhere before and under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
conditions which had possessed interest. As
George was measuring him closely, the glance
of the newcomer happened to rest upon him;
and into the small, deeply-set eyes there came
a look as puzzled as his own. For a moment
they stood thus, gazing at each other; then
the landlord spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friends, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;are in the
back parlor. They required that you be
shown in when you arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several times after this George encountered
the same person and each time he fell to
wondering who he was; and always did he
see speculation in the glances which the big
man leveled at him.</p>

<p>On Christmas day the inn was all a-bustle
with preparation. Colonel Rahl had suddenly
announced that he would hold a concert and
entertainment there; his own quarters were
not large enough to house the throng expected;
and as the inn parlors were big and
comfortable, the landlord had been given
notice to decorate them with greens and
candle-lights against the coming of the commander&#8217;s
guests. The regular lodgers at the
tavern were greatly inconvenienced by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
affair. The kitchens were mainly given up
to the cooking of Rahl&#8217;s dinner; and when
the patrons of the place did succeed in having
a meal prepared, they were forced to eat it in
all sorts of out-of-the-way places in order not
to be in the way of those hanging the decorations.</p>

<p>So George found himself dining alone in a
screened corner near to the fire early that
evening. A small dining party was placed,
after a little, upon the opposite side of the
screen; George paid no attention to them,
being busy with his own thoughts.</p>

<p>In a little time the waiters had finished
their hammering and hanging; and the first
voice that George caught from the party beyond
the screen was that of the burly man
whom he thought he knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; this person was saying, with a
great laugh, &#8220;she is coming here to-night, is
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>A smoother voice replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she&#8217;s stopping with the Hawksworths,
I understand. And they&#8217;ll be sure
to be here. They are great friends of Rahl&#8217;s,
you see.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>When this last person began to speak,
George started in astonishment. It could not
be! But as it went on he was convinced and
dumbfounded. The voice was that of Major
Hyde. And, as though to assure the young
New Englander that he was not mistaken,
Henderson, the dragoon officer, now spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon my word,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Rahl is a
great fellow. He pulls the string and they
all dance like puppets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your uncle, Mr. Camp, will also be present,
I suppose,&#8221; said the burly man, apparently
to Hyde.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; answered the major. &#8220;He&#8217;s
still brooding over the ashes of his manor
house, I believe; they can&#8217;t induce him to
leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would be a trifle astonished to see us
here,&#8221; said the dragoon with another laugh,
in which the big man joined.</p>

<p>&#8220;And scarcely pleased, I fancy,&#8221; said Hyde.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not pleased!&#8221; There was incredulity in
the other&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Not pleased to know that
you&#8217;ve really been a king&#8217;s man all along, and
not a rebel. Oh, come now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyde a king&#8217;s man! George&#8217;s knife fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
with a clatter to the floor, so great was his
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I say is more likely than not to be
a fact,&#8221; answered Hyde. &#8220;Herbert, it seems,
made no real interest with the old gentleman
in shifting his colors. I saw that long since.
You see,&#8221; with a sneer in his voice, &#8220;my
worthy uncle is one of those who prefer what
they call principle to the gaining of victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd!&#8221; growled the burly man. There
was a pause, then he continued in another
tone: &#8220;But it seems to me that you have
made your real sympathies known too soon.
The rebellion is not yet put down. If you had
remained with Washington&#8217;s army, you would
have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would have graced the end of a rope,&#8221;
said Henderson. &#8220;And I should have borne
him company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! They suspected you, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were only waiting to make sure,&#8221;
said Hyde. &#8220;I got wind of a letter written
by Tryon to Matthews in which I was referred
to&mdash;not by name, to be sure, but near enough
to be dangerous. That told me that my stay
in the American lines was limited.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;Tryon is an idiot,&#8221; commented the
dragoon. &#8220;How a man can so trust intimate
matters to pen and ink is more than I can
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; was the thought of the listener.
&#8220;Herbert Camp spoke the truth then. Hyde
was the nephew of whom Tryon wrote.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was high time for us to go,&#8221; said Henderson.
&#8220;I felt it in my bones, days before
the Long Island fight. That fellow Prentiss
seemed growing too keen to be comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prentiss?&#8221; the big man repeated the name
inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the messenger sent us from Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! that was his name, was it? Now,
there was a confounded knave for you. He
was willing to sell us all out to Putnam, I&#8217;m
told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And he&#8217;d just as willingly sold out
Putnam to us. It made little difference to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fortunate that we received word as to
his true character when we did,&#8221; said Henderson.
&#8220;Otherwise he would have come to
know every man of us for what we really
were.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;You should have got rid of the scoundrel,&#8221;
growled the burly man. &#8220;There are more
ways than one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We tried several,&#8221; said Hyde. &#8220;Once we
invited him to dinner to our place in Wall
Street. But he refused.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shudder ran through the listener. He
had indeed been near to death on that spring
evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Henderson had a shot at him later&mdash;in
my uncle&#8217;s house on Crown Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Henderson!&#8221; George almost cried this
aloud, so great was his astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I missed,&#8221; complained the dragoon.
&#8220;You see, I couldn&#8217;t get a proper bead on
him. I was in a sort of closet behind one of
Hyde&#8217;s ancestor&#8217;s portraits, and was forced to
shoot through a hole in one of the eyes. And
even though I missed, I almost lost my life
for the shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who stood in the middle of the room
when I tore out of the closet, but Mistress
Peggy Camp. Poof! What a tiger cat!&#8221;
The burly man exclaimed wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy,&#8221; said Hyde, &#8220;has always been an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
eager little rebel. And because I was such
an ardent patriot,&#8221; laughingly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always
had her respect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You once counted upon having more than
that, if I remember aright. You wanted her
as your wife when you thought she&#8217;d be made
heiress to the old man&mdash;vice Herbert, dismissed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Herbert&#8217;s sudden shift to the
British side of the house spoiled all that.
So we&#8217;ll not discuss it.&#8221; Hyde&#8217;s voice was
cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so Peggy flew at you for taking a
shot at Prentiss, did she?&#8221; said the burly
man. &#8220;He&#8217;d fooled her into thinking him a
staunch Whig, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; answered Henderson,
&#8220;she was convinced that he was a traitor to
the American cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She fancied that I, the patriot officer,
sought his life for that very reason,&#8221; said
Major Hyde. &#8220;That night in Crown Street,
she saw me enter the room where Henderson
was already concealed behind the picture. At
first I thought she had been in the room
when I entered, and was afraid she knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
Henderson&#8217;s purpose. But later, I was convinced
that this was not so.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rascal in the next room had been
of service to her in some way. She said
she knew he was a traitor to her countrymen&mdash;she
realized that he was all that
was bad. But, for all that, I must not harm
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was I, and not Herbert, for whom she
pleaded,&#8221; was the listener&#8217;s thought. &#8220;But,
then, I heard Herbert&#8217;s name mentioned; I
heard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the time,&#8221; laughed Hyde, &#8220;I knew
that her brother was hiding in the house.
There were many arrests just then, and I
suppose he feared being taken. I promised
Peggy that I&#8217;d say nothing of his presence;
but I warned her to beware of Prentiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time, George understood the
conversation which had taken place in the
room next the tapestried chamber. They had
spoken of him at first; but later the talk had
shifted to Herbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prentiss,&#8221; went on Major Hyde, &#8220;had
filled her with fear, for all her determination
to save him. I told her that he was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
house for no other purpose than the tracking
of her brother. This I thought might induce
her to leave the fellow in our hands to do
with as we pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she didn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; she was frightened, but apparently
had full faith in herself to deal with the
situation. I went away, thinking she too
would go to her room. But she must have
suspected something, and was still where I
left her when the shot was fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you succeeded in fastening
upon Prentiss beside the charge from Boston
that he was carrying water upon both shoulders?&#8221;
inquired the big man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We made a try, that same night in Crown
Street,&#8221; said the dragoon. &#8220;But he&#8217;s such a
sharp villain that we were hard put to it to
avoid suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to make him admit that he&#8217;d betrayed
Dana or young Camp to Putnam,&#8221; said
Hyde. &#8220;But he avoided us; and we were
forced to pass the thing off as a sort of
wager.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at length there was a pushing back of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
chairs upon the other side of the screen; the
score was settled, after some argument with
the waiter; George heard the sound of feet
crossing the floor, mingled voices in talk that
was both loud and light; then a door closed
upon them.</p>

<p>The youth looked at his watch. It was
after eight o&#8217;clock. Hastily he settled for his
dinner, and rising, was helped on with his
greatcoat. Feeling in his pocket to make sure
that he had his tinder box, he came from behind
the screen and made for the street
door with quick steps.</p>

<p>Not once did he glance about him. If he
had done so he would have noted that all of
the Major Hyde party had not gone. The
burly man still remained, and as George hurried
by him, he glanced up. The same speculation
filled his eyes that always entered
them at the sight of George; but this time
recognition quickly followed. His heavy
jaws snapped together, mastiff-like, and as the
door closed behind the lad, he arose to his
feet and called for his hat and coat. And as
George had felt carefully for his tinder box,
so did this man feel for his pistol; and being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
satisfied that it was in its place he opened
the door and set doggedly after the other
through the Christmas lighted streets of
Trenton.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>TELLS HOW A FIRE WAS KINDLED ON A
HILLSIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> all sides were lighted windows; and
through each of them could be seen groups of
Hessians feasting or dancing; the sounds of
singing and laughter came from every quarter.
Through the day, George Prentiss&#8217; quick eye
had noted the increasing lack of military deportment
among the mercenaries; and now
that night had come, things had grown worse.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fire, when I light it, will be allowed
to burn,&#8221; thought the young fellow, grimly,
as he pushed his way through the snow.
&#8220;And when Washington&#8217;s rifles are banging
about their ears, perhaps they&#8217;ll regret their
feastings and frolickings.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a little while he was in the select quarter
of the town. Here the festival was being observed
with less grotesquery; and every now
and then a sleigh flitted by, crowded with
merrymakers on their way to Colonel Rahl&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
concert. At the door of the Hawksworth mansion
stood a number of gracefully modeled
cutters, each with a spirited team and a great
number of jingling bells. Apparently quite
a party were going from here to the concert;
they were trooping down the steps laughing
and chattering; several footmen held lanthorns
aloft; the ice upon the stone steps and
pavement glittered like glass.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an exclamation; a girl
slipped and would have fallen had not young
Prentiss deftly caught her. She murmured a
&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and looked into his face.</p>

<p>But, so filled was he with the importance
of his errand, that he had not even noted that
the house was Hawksworth&#8217;s; so he failed to
recognize the face behind the heavy veil. All
unknowing, he touched his hat and hurried
on. She recognized him, however, for the
light from a lanthorn had fallen directly
upon his face; and she gasped to see him
here, of all places in the world. Her friends
were laughing and chattering still, and calling
to each other from the different sleighs;
but she never heeded them. Standing at
one side she gazed after the dimming figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
pushing its way so doggedly through the
snow.</p>

<p>And as she stood there, she became aware
of something else. There was another figure&mdash;a
burly, towering figure that possessed an
atmosphere at once cautious and threatening.
The huge shoulders were bent, the head was
drawn down, the step was careful, the whole
manner one of secrecy and observation. That
this person was following the boy seemed beyond
doubt; and the girl choked back a little
cry as she realized it.</p>

<p>Apparently under the impression that the
entire party was wrapped in the robes and
tucked away in the sleighs, the horses were
given rein and started away amid a great
jingling of bells. But still Peggy Camp paid
no heed. For a moment she stood, her eyes
following the burly, secretive pursuer; then
with sudden resolution she gathered her cloak
about her and stole away in the broad track
which he left in the snow.</p>

<p>When George reached the point above the
town where his friend had crossed, he stopped
for a moment and gazed out over the river.
Not even a twinkle of light could be seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
from the Pennsylvania shore; the snow was
falling thickly; the bitter wind had broken
the ice into huge cakes, and these were grinding
together ominously.</p>

<p>But his pause was only of a moment&#8217;s duration.
Upon the hillock of which Nat had
spoken, a heap of brush, carefully covered from
the snow, was collected. George had taken
this precaution the day before. Shielding his
operations with his hat, he struck a spark and
fired the brush; the flame began to lick at the
dry twigs hungrily; the dark red tongues
leaped from point to point at the bottom of
the heap. As the wind struck it, the mounting
fire bur-r-r-red complainingly; and satisfied
that it had safely caught, George stepped
back. As he did so he heard a step at his
side; upon the point of whirling about he
heard a low voice say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah! You would, would you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then came a tremendous blow upon the side
of his head and he fell stunned upon the hillside.
The cold touch of the snow, however, instantly
revived him; with his muscles lax and
powerless he lay there, his eyes rolling about until
they became fixed upon a form at the fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>&#8220;A signal, eh?&#8221; The big man laughed,
and the leaping flame lighted up his face.
And, as it did so, George, strangely enough,
knew him. It was the bully, Slade, whom he
had seen at the &#8220;King&#8217;s Arms&#8221; on his first
day in New York. &#8220;A signal, was it, my
hearty? Well, we&#8217;ll soon put an end to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a massive walking stick, apparently
the weapon with which he had felled young
Prentiss, he began scattering the brush.</p>

<p>Unsteadily, George got upon his feet; waveringly
he advanced. For the fire to be instantly
quenched meant that the American
army must not venture across the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know but what this would
bring the entire swarm of rebels down upon
us?&#8221; growled Slade. He lifted his cudgel for
another blow at the burning brush, when he
felt himself shouldered aside; and when he
turned he found himself staring into a wide
mouthed pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will kindly not disturb this fire,&#8221;
said the young New Englander. &#8220;It cost me
some little effort to build it, and I&#8217;d prefer
having it burn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bristling and snarling more like a bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
mannered mastiff than ever, Slade regarded
the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;All such things as fire are forbidden on
the river bank,&#8221; said he, rather lamely.</p>

<p>George laughed. &#8220;They will have to do
something more than forbid, to make me put
this one out,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was right, then,&#8221; said Slade. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
signal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your privilege to guess. And it is
also mine to refuse an answer,&#8221; smiled the
young man.</p>

<p>Though he kept the pistol upon Slade, George
noticed that the fire was waning. He began
kicking the brush together that it might burn
better; particles of snow flew among the light
flames and hissed and sputtered.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much of the conversation did you
overhear at the inn about an hour ago?&#8221;
asked Slade.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought.&#8221; The small eyes
snapped viciously beneath the heavy brows.
&#8220;Then you know that you&#8217;ve never deceived
us. We knew that you were playing fast and
loose from the first.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>&#8220;Your messenger from Boston was suspected
of being a traitor, was he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suspected?&#8221; Slade laughed at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was his name?&#8221; asked George,
quietly.</p>

<p>Slade hesitated; then a curious look came
into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;We never heard,&#8221; said he finally.</p>

<p>It was George who laughed this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Dana is a curious old fellow,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I wonder if he always jumps so at conclusions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Slade stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I am not the messenger? Exactly.
Your man must have missed the &#8216;Nancy
Breen.&#8217; I bore dispatches, but they were to
General Putnam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slade eyed him narrowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said he, &#8220;will astonish Major
Hyde.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more than my learning that that same
gentleman is a British spy astonished me,&#8221;
replied George.</p>

<p>The fire was not burning as he desired it.
Smiling quietly at the amazed look of Slade,
George incautiously lowered the pistol and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
proceeded to arrange the dryest of the brush.
This lapse was like to have been his last act
on earth, for Slade bounded upon him like a
wild beast. The pistol was knocked from his
grasp, and he was crushed to the ground under
the man&#8217;s bulk. But the few minutes that
had passed since the first blow had seen the
youth&#8217;s strength come back in a great degree.
He twisted about, grappled with Slade, and
they went writhing and rolling about in the
snow.</p>

<p>The Tory had little idea of the work in
which he was now engaged; with his tremendous
power he should have beaten his
lighter opponent into submission in short
order. But, save in clumsy wrestling, he did
not know how to use his strength. George,
on the other hand, never missed a point; he
clutched the other by the neck-cloth and
twisted it until he had him gasping; and
now and then, when he had a chance, he let
go with one hand and dashed it into the contorted
face.</p>

<p>With the blood streaming from mouth and
nose, Slade continued the struggle; slowly the
boy was strangling him; the breath labored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
in his huge chest; in the mounting firelight
his small eyes seemed ready to start from his
head.</p>

<p>During the entire fight, George&#8217;s great dread
was that the fire might die out through want
of attention. He did not fear Slade, or the
outcome of the struggle; but that the waiting
Americans upon the west bank might misread
his signal gave him much anxiety. Even in
the midst of the battling, he managed to keep
his attention on the fire. Instead of dying
out it grew stronger and stronger; indeed, it
roared and sparkled bravely in the wind; its
light made the hillside as plain as day.
Amazed at this, George finally managed to
twist about so in Slade&#8217;s clutch that he got
a good view of the fire. Still more amazed
was he to see a slight form hovering beside it
and heaping brush upon it with a generous
hand. And as he looked, a clear voice said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind this; it is my work. Take
care of that man, and leave the fire to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a sort of fierce joy in his heart,
George proceeded to do as he was bidden.
But Slade had heard the voice and now saw
what was going forward. The fear of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
might be the outcome of the beacon light
caused him to lose his head. With a wild
jerk he freed himself from the young man
and leaped to his feet. As he rushed toward
the blaze, George was after him like a cat,
snatching his heavy pistol from the snow as
he went. Slade&#8217;s arms were outstretched to
seize the girl when the steel barrel fell upon
his head; and like an ox he went down in his
tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; spoke the young man quietly, as he
looked at Peggy Camp, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll be so good
as to go on as you were, I&#8217;ll see to trussing
this fellow up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word the girl fed the brush to
the hungry flames; with the man&#8217;s own belt
and his woolen neckerchief, George pinioned
his arms and legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very awkward to handle,&#8221; said the
youth when this was accomplished, &#8220;and it&#8217;s
just as well to have him safe.&#8221; Then he
turned and helped her with a tangled mass of
brush which she found it difficult to move.
&#8220;How did you happen here?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you coming this way,&#8221; she answered
simply. &#8220;And I saw him,&#8221; with a nod<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
toward Slade, &#8220;following you. He looked as
if he meant harm, so I followed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did!&#8221; He gazed at her steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have served me more than once,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;And then, you are my cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>George started with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have known it all along&mdash;from the first,
almost. And that is why I have been so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated, and he added a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Contemptuous,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt sure that you knew who Herbert
was,&#8221; she said, very low, &#8220;and that you
should be the one to hunt him down seemed
unnatural.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not reply; and side by side they
stood by the fire watching it curl and roar in
the wind. Then she said: &#8220;A few moments
ago I heard you say that Major Hyde was a
British spy. Was that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was. I had it from his own lips this
very night.&#8221; Again he looked at her in the
same steady way; then he added: &#8220;Some
curious things have happened and some
equally curious misunderstandings have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
sprung up since that morning on the wharf
near the &#8216;Brigantine.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have begun to fear so,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even at the first,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I could have
explained some of them. But you would not
allow me. Now, however, I can explain all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask your pardon for anything which I
have done or said amiss.&#8221; She spoke gently.
&#8220;If you are ready to tell me these things, I
am more than ready to listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so there, on the bleak hillside, with
the snow falling and the bitter wind shrieking
about them, he began his tale. Dana&#8217;s
mistake; his own selection by Putnam to
trace out the conspirators; Hyde&#8217;s plot to
have his life because he thought him a false
agent to the Tory cause. And here the girl
interrupted him for the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, then, is what Major Hyde meant
when he spoke one night with Captain Henderson
at my uncle&#8217;s house in Crown Street.
He was plotting your destruction. He said
you were as false to them. I thought he
spoke as an American officer. That is why
I warned you against coming into the city
upon the night that you rescued my brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
and myself at the &#8216;Wheat Sheaf.&#8217; I felt sure
that you had betrayed the American cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then George proceeded with his narrative.
He told how he had given up the mission
because of his relationship to them, and how
he had plainly told General Putnam why.
Then he watched the joy in her face as he
related what he had heard Herbert tell his
uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my brother is not a renegade!&#8221; she
cried, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would seem not,&#8221; replied George.
&#8220;And it would seem that General Putnam
was in touch with all the facts and all his
movements.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this they spoke of the eventful night
at Corbie&#8217;s tavern. The girl listened, and
when he had finished, he saw doubt once
more in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you suspect,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I knew my
brother intended going there that night, as
I did on the night at the &#8216;Wheat Sheaf.&#8217;
And I followed to do what I could to save
him from danger. But if he was innocent,&#8221;
and her eyes fixed themselves gravely upon
George, &#8220;why did he see fit to hide afterward?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>&#8220;In the light of what I now know,&#8221; answered
George, &#8220;it is clear enough. He feared
that he had been recognized and would be
arrested. In that event it would be necessary
to call upon General Putnam; of course, he
would then be released; but at the same
time, this release might cause a suspicion of
the real state of affairs to get abroad, and
so ruin his chances to eventually worm himself
into the secrets of the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then recounted how he had been met
and been invited by her uncle to their New
York home; he was about to tell his conversation
with Major Hyde and the dragoon
when she interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard it all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;By accident
I was seated at the window behind the curtain;
and that conversation convinced me
more and more that you were what I had
come to think you&mdash;a person in the pay of
both sides&mdash;one willing to betray either, according
to which way your interest pointed.&#8221;
Her hand touched his arm lightly, imploringly.
&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>After this came the story of the tapestried
chamber from his point of view; then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
told what Hyde had said about it. She hung
her head.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_314.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;IT&#8217;S THE ARMY OF WASHINGTON&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;I could not see you harmed, no matter
what you had done,&#8221; she said, simply. &#8220;In
spite of all that I then believed against you,
I could not forget who you were and that
you had behaved bravely more than once in
my behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they talked and talked and the
time sped by. For more than an hour the
brush fire crackled on the hillside; and then,
when no more fuel was to be had, it was
permitted to die away. But still the youth
and the girl waited, their garments wrapped
about them snugly, for the wind grew more
bitter with each passing moment. Then from
across the ice-choked river long lines of light
began to dimly flicker.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the army of Washington,&#8221; said George,
and there was exultation in his voice. &#8220;They
are about to embark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that,&#8221; said Peggy Camp, awed, &#8220;is
really the answer to the signal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; answered he. &#8220;And in a few hours,
there will, perhaps, be a new master in the
town of Trenton.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>And so they stole away through the darkness
and snow toward the town.</p>

<p>And when they had disappeared, the burly
figure on the ground began to writhe and
tug at the bonds that held him. After a
long struggle, the neck-cloth began to stretch
and slip; a half minute later it had fallen
from his arms. Then the belt was off and
Slade got painfully upon his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are to have a crossing of the river
and a surprise, are we?&#8221; said he, as he hobbled
toward the town. &#8220;Well, we shall see about
that, my lad.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW THE CONCERT WAS INTERRUPTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> George Prentiss and Peggy Camp
reached the inn, they found it brilliant with
lights, festoons of green branches and laurels
hung all about; holly berries gleamed redly
against their backgrounds of somber leaves.
The public rooms were alive with merrymakers;
the gleaming costumes of the ladies
mingled with the rich European uniforms
of the German and English officers. Bright
looks and happy laughter were everywhere;
the beloved band of Colonel Rahl throbbed
through a German waltz.</p>

<p>Peggy instantly sought out Mrs. Hawksworth;
what explanation she made of her
absence, George did not know; but he noted
that both Mrs. Hawksworth and her cold-faced
husband looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p>It was then past midnight; George was on
fire to be off that he might watch for Washington&#8217;s
coming; but he knew that this would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
be both dangerous and useless, and so he
remained where he was.</p>

<p>The clock struck two, and then pointed to
the half hour before Peggy came to him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;They forbade me speaking to you until
they had heard and understood everything
concerning my escapade, as they call it,&#8221; she
laughed. &#8220;And so I had to steal away.&#8221;
Then, eagerly: &#8220;What have you heard? Are
they really coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard nothing,&#8221; said George. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t hope to get news before the last moment.
The rifles will then tell us what we are to
expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get the picture of those great
blocks of ice out of my mind,&#8221; she said, with
a shudder. &#8220;And then the river looked so
dark and so deep. And it was so cold and
pitiless.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood by one of the windows at the
front of the inn; the room, save for a few
other couples, was deserted. Through an open
doorway at one side they could see the dancers
whirl by; also there came the gleam of the
brass instruments and the high-colored uniforms
of the bandsmen. Another open door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
showed the numerous parties grouped about
the tables engrossed in their game. Colonel
Rahl was among those nearest the door; opposite
him sat Mr. Hawksworth, and grouped
about the table were numerous officers and
Tory residents of quality.</p>

<p>&#8220;The colonel is ill prepared, should things
go as we wish,&#8221; whispered George.</p>

<p>&#8220;The worse prepared, the better for our
friends,&#8221; said Peggy, sagely.</p>

<p>The snow all about the inn was packed
hard by the steady tramping of the Hessian
guard. Under a beefy sergeant they kept all
intruders at a distance; the squeaking of their
boots and the clanking of their equipment
were constant.</p>

<p>Three o&#8217;clock struck, and it was some time
afterward that George became aware of an altercation
going on outside the window where
they sat. Since seeing Hyde and Henderson
he had kept himself much in the background,
but all matters in any way unusual were quick
to draw his attention. So he turned at once
to see what was going forward.</p>

<p>The beefy sergeant and a number of his
men were grouped outside; in their midst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
was a burly figure with a face blood-clotted, a
shirt-frill crimson and with the bearing of
one about to sink down from exhaustion.
His legs seemed to sag beneath him; his big
head weakly swayed from side to side; his
hands pawed at the Hessians in an effort to
hold himself erect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slade!&#8221; exclaimed George, under his
breath. And as he said it, he stepped back
from the window, drawing Peggy away also.
&#8220;He&#8217;s slipped out of the things I tied him up
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he suspect anything, do you think?&#8221;
whispered the girl. &#8220;Did he hear what we
said as we talked by the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s here to give warning.&#8221; She
drew in her breath in a great frightened gasp,
and her eyes were fixed upon the blood-smeared
man swaying so weakly in the snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Rahl!&#8221; they heard him say.
&#8220;Colonel Rahl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about him?&#8221; demanded the
fat sergeant, waving away the pawing hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see him&mdash;at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant laughed. His men, who understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
almost no English, looked at Slade
with stolid indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must see him,&#8221; said the sergeant
&#8220;Plenty peoples think the same as yourself
to-night.&#8221; He waved a hand. &#8220;Poof! Get
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I must see him,&#8221; said Slade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make me no troubles,&#8221; advised the Hessian
sergeant. &#8220;Get away, or you&#8217;ll feel der
ramroad your back across.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have business with him&mdash;important
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Der colonel no business listens to, to-night
yet,&#8221; stated the beefy sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll listen to this,&#8221; cried Slade, desperately,
almost sinking down in the snow from
very weakness. &#8220;Ask him to give me a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the sergeant, bored, gestured him away.
Two of the men seized him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; cried Slade. &#8220;Just a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>From his pockets he took a number of
broad gold pieces; and at sight of them the
sergeant&#8217;s eyes shone.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are yours,&#8221; said Slade, &#8220;if you carry
a note to your colonel.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>The sergeant nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Business so important as dot,&#8221; grinned
he, &#8220;must be attended to, a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a command of the sergeant, one of the
soldiers brought an ink pot and a quill from
the headquarters across the way; with weak,
numbed fingers, Slade scrawled a few lines
upon a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take that to him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That will
answer, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant accepted the note and the gold
pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inside,&#8221; said he, pointing to headquarters,
&#8220;a fire is by der hall. Go there and wait.
When I der time get, I&#8217;ll give this to der
colonel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will wait der fire beside,&#8221; stated the
fat sergeant. &#8220;To my own affairs I will attend
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>As there was nothing to be gained by insistence,
Slade turned and limped slowly
across the street; then the door opened and
closed behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he gives that note to Colonel Rahl,&#8221;
breathed Peggy, &#8220;it may destroy everything.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s half-past three,&#8221; replied George,
quietly, looking at his watch. &#8220;The army
has more than likely now reached this side
of the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do you think so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. But,&#8221; and there was an anxious
note in his voice, &#8220;for all that, if the message
did not come under the eyes of Rahl, it would
be much better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here came a loud shout of laughter from
Rahl. He had won. His face was flushed
and exultant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I have not yet forgotten
the game.&#8221; Then noting that his
band had ceased playing he added, with a
frown: &#8220;What is the matter with the music?
Eh? Tell them to play. What do I pay the
swine for?&#8221; Then to his companions,
&#8220;Come, deal, deal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Muddled, excited, engrossed in his game,
the leader of the Hessians had no thought of
his trust; had any one spoken of an American
attack at that moment, he would have
been treated as one beneath contempt. On
and on went the game, the dance and the
throbbing of the band; the minutes passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
and grew in number; the long hand of
young Prentiss&#8217; watch climbed slowly upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said at last to Peggy,
who sat huddled in her cloak in the outer
room. &#8220;It would seem that the sergeant has
forgotten Slade&#8217;s note entirely.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Slade had arrived at this conclusion
also was at that moment made evident; he
came out of the headquarters across the way,
his face cleansed of the blood stains and seeming
much stronger. At once he accosted the fat
sergeant. That worthy gazed at him stupidly
for a moment; his naturally sluggish brain
had been rendered more so than ever by the
cold of the early morning; then he remembered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach! Donner und blitz!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I
have not der colonel spoken to yet. But I
will. Stand here der door by.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, he entered the outer room where
George and Peggy stood alone by the fire.
The sergeant saluted awkwardly; he was a
plain man, and the lights and beautiful
women in the rooms beyond rather bewildered
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>Instantly Peggy was at his side, smiling
and bewitching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you want anything, sergeant?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the fat man&#8217;s hand went to his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;A message for der colonel, Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But,&#8221; with a glance toward the card
room, &#8220;he don&#8217;t like to be disturbed when he
blays. So I will wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had turned to go when Peggy stopped
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;A message,&#8221; she said, insinuatingly. &#8220;It
might be important. Give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will hand it to him, Fr&auml;ulein?&#8221;
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure&mdash;and before very long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danke sch&ouml;n.&#8221; The man went out, leaving
Slade&#8217;s note in her hand.</p>

<p>George looked at her; there was admiration
in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was very clever,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was necessary,&#8221; answered Peggy, and
she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you promised to give it to Rahl,&#8221; said
George, his eyes now on the message.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. And I will&mdash;but not until it is
too late to do harm.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>Again they stood together before the hearth,
watching the curling flames and the darting
sparks. Then suddenly he reared his head,
as he became aware of a jarring, far-off
sound. His eyes went to the window; a
Hessian guard had paused in his monotonous
tramping and stood as though listening.
Again it came, a sullen jarring, far off, yet
somehow plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; Peggy&#8217;s hand was on
his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. And yet it sounds
like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused as the sound came
again. &#8220;Yes, it is! It is volley firing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are here!&#8221; She bent her head to
catch the sound. &#8220;But it seems so far off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because of the snow. They are
firing on the outposts, and none of these are
stationed more than a half mile outside the
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once she left his side and started toward
the room where Rahl sat. And as she did so,
the tired musicians began to play once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; George was at
her side.</p>

<p>But she did not answer in words; between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
her fingers he saw the crumpled scrawl of the
Tory, Slade; and as she held it up, it replied
eloquently.</p>

<p>He followed her. The men and women
about the table were eagerly absorbed in the
game; the room was hot, and crowded with
onlookers. As the girl paused beside Colonel
Rahl, several players lifted their heads surprisedly;
the idlers as though they felt that
something was about to occur came a step
nearer to the Hessian leader&#8217;s table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Rahl,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>The man turned his flushed face toward her.
She held out the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;A message,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Your sergeant
brought it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; I will see to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the note and stuffed it feverishly
into his breast pocket, never once looking at
it; then he gave his attention once more to
the game.</p>

<p>George noted that the candles were beginning
to grow dim; and this told him that
dawn was at hand. Above the blare of the
brass throated instruments he fancied more
than once that he caught the scattering discharge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
of small arms. At length, unable to
stand the suspense, he turned to leave the
room; and as he did so, came face to face with
Major Hyde. A sarcastic smile lit the man&#8217;s
cold eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is something of a surprise,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But, nevertheless, I am very glad to see
you.&#8221; Then in a loud tone he added: &#8220;Colonel
Rahl, if you will summon the guard, I&#8217;ll
give this spy in charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spy!&#8221; Men and women sprang to their
feet; swords were drawn, chairs were overturned.
With a swift look over his shoulder
George saw Peggy&#8217;s face whiten; then like a
panther he sprang upon Hyde. Down went
the man as though stricken by a thunderbolt;
over his body leaped the young New Englander.
As he did so the outer door was flung
open and the fat sergeant bounced into the inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Der feind!&#8221; he roared. A volley of
musketry rolled through the streets. &#8220;Der
feind!&#8221;</p>

<p>George flashed by him and gained the
street; out of the inn poured Rahl and his
officers, excited, confused, buttoning up their
greatcoats and feeling for their swords.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;Heraus!&#8221; shouted Rahl, flashing his blade
from its sheath. &#8220;Heraus!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cry was taken up by the officers; the
Hessians, heavy eyed, gorged with feasting
and totally unfit for battle, thronged out of
the warm houses into the bitter night.
Drums were beating; the town was roaring
with fright.</p>

<p>A group of artillerymen formed behind the
half circle of guns before Rahl&#8217;s headquarters;
their matches were lighted and they waited
for the word that would scatter death into
the onrushing Americans. But there was no
officer collected enough to give it; and in another
instant the gunners were bayoneted at
their posts.</p>

<p>George Prentiss saw two forces of Americans,
coming from different directions, form a
junction; at their heads he recognized Sullivan
and the commander-in-chief himself. Seizing
the musket of a fallen Hessian, he joined the
massed column. A battery of six guns under
Forest was drawn up and opened upon Rahl
and his frantic brigade at a few hundred paces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot work,&#8221; said a voice at George&#8217;s side.
And turning he saw the forms of Ezra and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
Nat Brewster. Ben Cooper, his chubby cheek
pressed against a rifle-barrel, was drawing a
bead upon an enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you&#8217;re all right,&#8221; he nodded to
George. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you more about it
later on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the galling fire of Forest&#8217;s artillery,
Rahl drew his men off to the east side of the
town. Hand&#8217;s riflemen took up a place in
his rear while he was forming his command.
Desperate fighters that they were, the mercenaries
still had a chance to escape. But they
so despised the Americans, and their quarters
in the town were so stowed with plunder,
that they determined to stand their ground.
Rahl gave the word to charge. The Americans
braced to meet them, their rifles held
ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady! Steady!&#8221; ran through the columns.
&#8220;Hold your fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of this a scattering of bullets met
the Hessians as they began their charge.
Even in the dawn, the face of Washington
shone with exultation. Ezra, who stood
near him, heard him say to one of his
officers:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>&#8220;They are gorged like animals and cannot
fight long. After the first volley, we&#8217;ll give
them the bayonet.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later he lifted his hand; the
order to fire was given, and the onrushing
Hessians began to fall. Through the dimness
and smoke George saw Rahl press a hand
to his side and sway in his saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hit!&#8221; cried the lad.</p>

<p>And no sooner had the words left his
mouth than the Hessian leader pitched forward
under his horse&#8217;s feet. Dismayed at
his fall, the mercenaries faltered; then the
hardy colonials broke upon them with sword,
bayonet and pistol; but the sluggish, overfed
foreigners had no stomach for hard fighting
and in a few moments the cry went up for
quarter; and then to a man they threw down
their arms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was high noon before the last batch of
prisoners had been banded together to be
sent across the river; and half the American
force was busy in making ready the Hessian
stores and plunder for transportation. Now
and then a shot rang out which told of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
detected looter, or an unearthed enemy; but
for the most part the streets were quiet.</p>

<p>Private property, by Washington&#8217;s strict
order, was in every way protected. Before
the Hawksworth mansion paced a guard of
stalwart continentals; within was gathered a
party which laughed and talked joyously.
Stout old Merchant Camp shook Ezra Prentiss
by the hand for perhaps the tenth time.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you are Seth&#8217;s other grandson,
eh? Well, well! And both of you hold to
Washington and the Congress, you say!
Were there ever such times in the world before!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And grandfather, too, don&#8217;t forget that,&#8221;
laughed Ezra.</p>

<p>But the staunch old Tory did not laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Seth has gone over, too! Well, every
man to his own beliefs. I am alone among
you, but,&#8221; and his stubborn old head lifted
high, &#8220;I&#8217;m a king&#8217;s man still, and will be to
the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy and her brother, Herbert, together
with young Brewster, Ben Cooper and
George, were grouped at the fireside. First
Peggy would look at George and then at Ezra.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>&#8220;I am almost frightened, Cousin George,&#8221;
she said in an awed sort of way, &#8220;when I
look at you both. You look so much alike
that it&#8217;s really uncanny.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heavy-browed Herbert, who proved a
most companionable fellow, said to Ben,
aside:</p>

<p>&#8220;They look alike, but it is not possible
that Ezra is as great a fellow as George. It
would be expecting too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ben waved the notion aside at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no greater chap than Ezra
Prentiss in the army,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And after
you&#8217;ve come to know him, you&#8217;ll say so yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said old Mr. Camp to something
which Ezra had just remarked. &#8220;Howe is
at New York; I&#8217;ll go back there; that is the
place for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll probably meet with Cousin Hyde
and his friend Henderson there,&#8221; said Peggy.
&#8220;Mr. Brewster has just been telling me that
they escaped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pair of rascals, my dear,&#8221; said the old
gentleman. &#8220;I want nothing to do with
them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>&#8220;You will go back to New York also, I suppose,&#8221;
said George to Peggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, proudly. &#8220;I have lived
my last under British rule. Herbert will
take me to Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; spoke Ezra, &#8220;we&#8217;ll see you often,
more than likely, for, if the indications are
to be trusted, the army will be thereabouts
for some time to come.&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
